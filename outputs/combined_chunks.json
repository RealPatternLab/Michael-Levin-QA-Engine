When interpreted through the lens of the Conway-Kochen theorem and the Free Energy Principle, contemporary physics characterizes all complex dynamical systems that persist through time as Bayesian agents. If all persistent systems are to some - perhaps only minimal – extent cognitive, are all persistent systems to some extent alive, or are living systems only a subset of cognitive systems? We argue that no bright line can be drawn, and we re-assess, from this perspective, the Fermi paradox and the Drake equation. We conclude that improving our abilities to recognize and communicate with diverse intelligences in diverse embodiments, whether based on familiar biochemistry or not, will either resolve or obviate the OOL problem.",

    "text": "The Origin of Life (OOL) problem is ordinarily thought of as a chemistry problem [1]: how can the right molecules, under the right conditions, be compartmentalized in a way that initiates an autocatalytic process that maintains not just the right molecular concentrations, but also the enabling conditions and the requisite compartmentalization? Many ideas have been suggested, typically focused on either autocatalysis or compartmentalization as the primary problem. It is widely believed that multiple OOL events could have occurred on the early Earth, with only one lineage – that of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all known life – surviving [2-4]. It is also widely believed that OOL events could occur elsewhere, prompting searches for evidence of extraterrestrial life by various means.\nThe OOL event leading to LUCA and its lineage is important in a number of related fields. First, it represents an originating singularity that must back-stop the reproductive cycle that is a cornerstone of evolutionary biology. Second, by effectively defining \"synthetic\" life, it sets a boundary condition on synthetic biology and bioengineering, both efforts to create and study life-as-it-could be [5] in novel implementations. Third, it is a critical fixed point for exo-biology, pushing us to define what it is that we are looking for on worlds beyond our planet, and to construct models of what different origin stories would mean for the further development of complexity and intelligence. Most crucially, it strongly impacts the very definition of \"life\": a standard account in which life is a distinct category set apart from non-living matter is challenged by the need to identify and explain a sharp phase transition in which life arose from non-life. Related to this are questions of the relationship of life and mind. Whatever theories we formulate for the minimal dynamics needed to create minds, it is imperative to understand their relationship to the OOL. The conventional view is that cognition arose at some point during life's expansion along an axis of complexity, i.e. that cognitive beings are a subset of living beings [6].",

    "text": "Here, we review an alternative way of thinking about the OOL problem that is motivated by the Conway-Kochen (CK) theorem [7,8], a result in fundamental physics, and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), a theoretical framework that originated in neuroscience [9,10] and has been extended over the past decade into a description of generic physical systems [11-16]. The CK theorem characterizes all physical systems as agential in the specific sense of displaying behavior that is not, even in principle, predictable from local causal influences. The FEP characterizes all physical systems as inferential in the specific sense of behaving as Bayesian satisficers. Together, the CK theorem and the FEP suggest a view of cognition that is substantially broader than mainstream views in biology, e.g. as represented in [6], and may even surprise advocates of basal cognition in, e.g. plants or microbes [17-21]. They suggest, in particular, that all complex systems are organizations of agential materials that perform Bayesian satisficing on multiple scales [22-24]. This in turn suggests that the OOL problem is not, or at least not just, a chemistry problem, but is rather a cognitive science problem: the problem of characterizing the level or type of cognition at which it becomes meaningful for a system to be considered living. It raises the questions of whether life and cognition are co-extensive, as many have argued [25-28], and of what specific attributes distinguish living cognitive systems from non-living cognitive systems if they are not. It suggests that developing methods to both identify and communicate with diverse intelligences with diverse embodiments that exhibit behavior in diverse state spaces [22,29–31] will be required to fully address the OOL problem.",

The proof is somewhat involved, and depends on the earlier Kochen-Specker theorem [32] showing that observations compliant with QT exhibit non-causal dependencies on context. The underlying intuition, however, is straightforward: the evolution of the quantum state of part of the universe can only be fully understood as a projection of the evolution of the quantum state of the entire universe. Local information, e.g. the information available from a past light cone, is never sufficient to completely specify a quantum state; this insufficiency of local information also underlies the Wootters-Zurek \"no-cloning\" theorem [33]. This is particularly clear in the case of spatially extended systems in entangled states, in which spacelike-separated components of a single system appear, in the laboratory reference frame of an observer, to have distinct past light cones. The insufficiency of local information for quantum state specification applies to both the observer and the observed system, replacing the \"if then\" formulation of the original theorem with the stronger formulation of the 2009 version.",

It is possible to write this off as \"randomness” or “stochasticity\" and hence to view it in essentially thermodynamic terms, but we note that doing so already provides the minimal requirement – a degree of autonomy – for a system to exist on the spectrum of agency, which can then be scaled up into higher forms of intelligence (with greater historicity, metacognition, etc.) by the processes of evolution or engineering. Here, we follow Wheeler [34], Fuchs [35], and others in interpreting the CK theorem, and indeed QT generally, as implying that all systems have a fundamentally agentic character. We will describe one way of formulating this in the next section: if two systems are distinguishable – formally, if their joint state is not entangled – they have independent and hence \"free\" choice of computations to perform on, and hence semantics to assign to, their inputs [36]. That such freedom of interpretation is the basis of agency is a key tenant of 2nd-order cybernetics [37-39].",

    "text": "The FEP describes the behavior of physical systems that can be distinguished from the environments in which they are embedded, and provides a criterion that such systems must satisfy in order to remain distinguishable from their environments over some period of time. It can be stated, in obviously tautological form, as the claim that any system that is distinguishable from its environment must behave in a way that maintains its distinguishability from its environment, from the perspective of an external observer, and possibly from its own perspective [11]. More technically, any such system must behave in a way that maintains the conditional statistical independence of its states from the states of its environment. The FEP describes the maintenance of conditional statistical independence as the asymptotic minimization of a variational free energy (VFE) [40] measured at the system-environment boundary, and describes the minimization of VFE as Bayesian satisficing. Intuitively, VFE is a measure of the system's uncertainty about what its environment will do to it next; hence VFE can be interpreted as a measure of the stress imposed on the system by its environment, and Bayesian satisficing can be interpreted as deciding how best to relieve this stress. The FEP can thus be viewed as providing a dictionary for translating descriptions of behavior in the languages of either classical dynamical systems [11-14] or QT [15,16] into the languages of the cognitive, and when many agents are involved, the social sciences. We will, in what follows, consistently use the term \"agent\" to refer to a system compliant with both the CK theorem and the FEP, recognizing that the scope of this usage comprises all physical systems that remain distinct from their environments over some time period of interest, and that this scope is considerably broader than that of some other usages of this term; see [41] for a general review and [42] for a review specific to biology.",

Are we justified in identifying the living with the cognitive, as argued by Maturana and Varela [25] or Pattee [26], if doing so extends the meaning of \"living system\" to include everything that persists through time? How important are often-cited functions such as replication, metabolism, or compartmentalization to the definition of \"life\" [55]? How important is organic chemistry - is it the exclusive source of complex systems, or can other chemistries also generate complex systems autonomously? Is it even worth trying to define life in general terms, given just the single example of the lineage of LUCA [56]?\nIt is worthwhile to consider the use of terminology in asking these questions. It is often held that applying cognitive terms to unconventional substrates (biochemical pathways, cells, organs, \"machines\", etc.) is useless wordplay at best, and a category error at worst. We propose an instrumentalist stance, where ontological categories are not taken as inviolable philosophical givens, but instead must be updated with the progress of science, and the degree of utility of terms comes from the interaction protocols they enable or suppress. For example, the statement that a system is roughly in position X on the spectrum of agency cashes out via the degree of empirical benefits provided by using tools from cognitive and behavioral science on that system. We have covered elsewhere [57–61] numerous examples of how such erasure of boundaries facilitates novel research programs and leads to new practical capabilities and discoveries, for example, in biomedicine and bioengineering. Thus, the idea that cognition is extremely widespread does not devalue the concept, but instead suggests experimental testing, in new systems, of tools and concepts that have proven useful for understanding conventional embodied minds.",

He showed that endocytosis (essentially membrane recycling) of cell membranes on one end of the cell is important for confined cell migration. Interestingly Plexins (classically known as axon guidance cues) are crucial for this endocytosis since CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Plexin-B2 knockout reduced membrane tension, decreased endocytosis of anionic phospholipids, and in turn caused a major hyperpolarization of cell membrane surface charges, which disrupted Ca²⁺ backflow necessary for confined migration of glioblastoma cells. This was a great example of connecting biochemical, bioelectric, and mechanical signals in controlling cell behavior.

This was an excellent example of a direct connection between the cytoskeleton and ion channels and Vmem. Using the tool developed, they also showed dynamic changes in Vmem associated with cell division and shape changes.",

    "text": "There were two very interesting talks from members of Julie Theriot's laboratory at University of Washington on investigating electrotaxis/galvanotaxis. Nathan Belliveau talked about identifying the genes that support neutrophil galvanotaxis. Inspired by a small-scale screen in *Dictyostelium* that identified signaling components that contribute to galvanotaxis, he showed results of a genome-wide unbiased genetic screen for loss of galvanotaxis in HL60 neutrophil-like cells where gene expression was perturbed using CRISPRi. Cells that perform galvanotaxis were separated from those that were defective in galvanotaxis, and their small guide RNAs were compared and analyzed. Out of 400 shortlisted knockdown perturbations, only a few exclusively affected galvanotaxis and did not affect regular migration. They identified TMEM154, a plasma membrane protein that is predicted to have its extracellular domain glycosylated and an intracellular domain containing phosphorylation motifs. TMEM154 (now called Galvanin) immediately localizes to the anodic (trailing/back) of the cells and appears to inhibit actin polymerization there. This could be one of the electric sensors in mammalian cells that is the fundamental mechanism behind the perception of electric fields by cells. Along similar lines, Mugdha Sathe talked about zebrafish T cell migration away from wounds due to endogenous electric fields. First, using a zebrafish skin explant system, she showed that neutrophils migrate toward the cathode at the same rate as the surrounding epidermal tissue, which also migrates to the cathode. In contrast, T cells migrate toward the anode in the opposite direction to the surrounding tissue and neutrophils. She confirmed this *in vivo* in zebrafish using a laceration model and showed that endogenous electric and osmotic cues are essential in curating the cell population at the wound site that is conducive for wound healing.",

Ca²⁺ was shown to be involved in a plethora of biological processes, from cell division, neural cell differentiation, cell migration, to morphogen secretion. This coincides with Ca²⁺ being a node of a bowtie network where there are a multitude of signal inputs into Ca²⁺ and a multitude of signaling outputs from Ca²⁺.  How Ca²⁺ can relay a specific input to a specific output is a complete mystery and a primed area of investigation. Perhaps looking at spatiotemporal dynamics and frequency modulation of Ca²⁺ signals might be key to understanding how Ca²⁺ is involved in many different signals and biological processes.",

    "text": "At the end of the session's discussion, it was acknowledged unanimously that the bioelectricity field has come a long way from its beginning, and topics important for the advancement and dissemination of the field of bioelectricity were discussed. Although the start of the bioelectricity field can be traced back to several centuries ago, bioelectricity is still an emerging research area, lagging behind other fields in terms of broad awareness among the biology and bioengineering communities. Areas such as molecular biology and genetics are further ahead in part because they depend on data that can be obtained from dead and fractionated cells. Bioelectricity is fundamentally a holistic property of living cells and tissues and cannot be resolved in fixed material or reduced to individual ion channel genes or proteins. Moreover, advances in bioelectricity often require the researcher to have a multidisciplinary background, including physics, physiology, evolutionary biology, and neuroscience. These barriers, and the resulting relatively limited appreciation and familiarity with the extant achievements in our field, still affect aspects such as the publication of rigorous scientific research in this field in high-impact journals. At the meeting, a need was identified to address a misperception of bioelectricity, a vague epiphenomenal or housekeeping parameter, rather than as an instructive signaling modality. This needs to be done proactively and energetically through good and extensive science outreach and communication not only among scientists (writing extensive reviews and articles addressing the issues and its history in good journals) but also among student curricula and the general public (educational materials, textbooks, books, and other avenues of public exposure to this field) about the incredible power, tractability, and usefulness of bioelectricity in biological processes. We know this is possible because the biomechanics field has taken a similar journey, moving from a niche topic to a well-accepted mainstream discipline recognized and studied by undergraduate and graduate students. This was mainly due to the development of powerful new *in vivo* techniques rendering biophysical parameters tractable and linking them to the key advances in the molecular cell biology field. Bioelectricity stands ready to take its place as a key lynchpin at the intersection of physical, genetic, and informational processes in living systems. Another issue raised was fractionation in the bioelectricity field and the isolation of these fractions. Particularly, much research is going on in the field of Material Research Society where there are useful biocompatible tools such as genetically encoded biosensors and techniques being developed by researchers, but they do not know or have heard about (and hence do not talk to) folks working on uncovering the role of bioelectricity in organismal systems, which could hugely benefit from them and vice versa for tool and technology applications. Similar is the issue with ion channel researchers who are part of the American Physiological Society who have not heard or are aware of the other two fractions. The field needs efforts to integrate these fractions so that we know about each other's work and collaborate and use each other's know-how to further the field and be a cohesive unit. One possible way mentioned to achieve this was through holding a regular conference or meeting that incorporates researchers from all these fractions of the bioelectricity field together. Tangentially, a need was also identified for efforts to integrate the Bioelectricity field into mainstream science by having a delegate of bioelectricity field researchers go to more general science conferences and gatherings to expose the broader scientific community to the usefulness and importance of this field. Along similar lines, even in the research happening within the sphere of uncovering bioelectricity's roles in biology, most researchers are working in isolation with customized tools and technologies built to serve their model system and the questions they are asking. These same tools could be extremely useful for other researchers in the bioelectricity field, and such exposure and cross-talk are needed, perhaps through the development of tutorials with nuances and details about how the customized technique works and in which model system. These tutorials could be updated when they are tested by another group on a different system as to whether they worked or not. Such a repository of custom tools, techniques, and know-how about the field of bioelectricity would be an extremely valuable resource for everyone working in the field and would reduce the barrier of entry into the field for young researchers. This could also be facilitated by having a virtual gathering on a semi-regular basis, perhaps as a retreat to talk about tools and techniques and progress in the field.",

    "text": "The Computational Boundary of a \"Self\": Developmental Bioelectricity Drives Multicellularity and Scale-Free Cognition\n\nMichael Levin\n\n[PAGE 1] All epistemic agents physically consist of parts that must somehow comprise an integrated cognitive self. Biological individuals consist of subunits (organs, cells, and molecular networks) that are themselves complex and competent in their own native contexts. How do coherent biological Individuals result from the activity of smaller sub-agents? To understand the evolution and function of metazoan creatures' bodies and minds, it is essential to conceptually explore the origin of multicellularity and the scaling of the basal cognition of individual cells into a coherent larger organism. In this article, I synthesize ideas in cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and developmental physiology toward a hypothesis about the origin of Individuality: “Scale-Free Cognition.” I propose a fundamental definition of an Individual based on the ability to pursue goals at an appropriate level of scale and organization and suggest a formalism for defining and comparing the cognitive capacities of highly diverse types of agents. Any Self is demarcated by a computational surface – the spatio-temporal boundary of events that it can measure, model, and try to affect. This surface sets a functional boundary - a cognitive \"light cone” which defines the scale and limits of its cognition. I hypothesize that higher level goal-directed activity and agency, resulting in larger cognitive boundaries, evolve from the primal homeostatic drive of living things to reduce stress – the difference between current conditions and life-optimal conditions. The mechanisms of developmental bioelectricity - the ability of all cells to form electrical networks that process information suggest a plausible set of gradual evolutionary steps that naturally lead from physiological homeostasis in single cells to memory, prediction, and ultimately complex cognitive agents, via scale-up of the basic drive of infotaxis. Recent data on the molecular mechanisms of pre-neural bioelectricity suggest a model of how increasingly sophisticated cognitive functions emerge smoothly from cell-cell communication used to guide embryogenesis and regeneration. This set of hypotheses provides a novel perspective on numerous phenomena, such as cancer, and makes several unique, testable predictions for interdisciplinary research that have implications not only for evolutionary developmental biology but also for biomedicine and perhaps artificial intelligence and exobiology.",

    "text": "[PAGE 2] INTRODUCTION: DEEP PROBLEMS WITH SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL IN COMMON\n\nWhy did some competent unicellular organisms join together to form complex bodies, and how do they cooperate during highly robust embryogenesis and regeneration of anatomical structures? Why does this process break down during carcinogenic defection from the body plan? How can we best understand and control biological systems that consist of numerous nested levels of organization, such as bacteria and biofilms, which can functionally interact with the host's cells, tissues, and organs? How are lower level (molecular and cellular) activities harnessed toward adaptive system-level outcomes during regulative development and adaptation to novel stressors? What is the relationship between the ability of cells to implement invariant organ-level morphogenetic goal states and the purposive activity of brains? What dynamics enable the scaling of cognitive capacities from the simple memory functions found in bacteria to those of sophisticated minds?\n\nAll these fundamental biological problems have one thing in common: the need to understand and formalize what a coherent Individual or Agent is, in a way that is compatible with a gradual co-evolution of minds and bodies (Tarnita et al., 2013). While significant work has addressed this topic from an evolutionary perspective, I suggest a different and complementary view called Scale-Free Cognition, synthesizing ideas from theories of computation and control to identify common information-processing events occurring at multiple levels of organization. I propose a semi-quantitative metric, based on the spatio-temporal boundaries of events that systems measure and try to control, that can be used to define and compare the cognitive boundaries for highly diverse types of agents (which could be biological, exo-biological, or artificial). Ideas from the fields of proto-cognition, developmental biophysics, and information theory offer a novel lens with which to understand the evolution, development, physiology, and behavior of a wide range of living systems. Focusing on information processing and decision-making enables a unifying conception of goal-directedness in biological systems, which naturally scales from simple homeostatic pathways to complex cognition via evolutionarily ancient physiological mechanisms of cell-cell communication. Here, I illustrate these hypotheses from the perspective of developmental bioelectricity, which evolution has robustly exploited for cognitive scaling; however, the same general scheme applies to any similar mechanism, whether chemical, physical, or other.",

    "text": "[PAGE 3] WHAT IS A SELF? DEFINING \"INDIVIDUALS\"\n\n\"Of course there is no question that a tree or an elephant is one individual, and we have a very clear mental picture of what this means, for we ourselves are individuals. But there are lower forms in the borderland between one-celled organisms and multicellular organisms that are more bothersome in this respect.\" -J. T. Bonner, 1950\n\nNeuroscientists (and philosophers of mind) have long wrestled with the question of how many can add up to one - a \"conceptual self that is composed of interacting neural regions” with centralized agency and planning (Murray et al., 2015). But this is not just a key question for neurobiology: as will be seen below, important aspects of biomedicine also hinge on the ability to identify higher-order control structures composed of cells or pathways. Epistemology requires a subject (whoever it is that does or does not know something), and this is critical not only for human philosophers but also for many animals. Survival depends on evolving finely tuned agency detectors that allow them to parse their world into agents that pursue recognizable goals and can be interacted with in a way different than with their parts (Mar et al., 2007).\n\nExobiologists may at some point be confronted with the task of understanding what aspect of an alien ecosystem constitutes some sort of coherent biological Individual. This is likely to be a very non-trivial task, as even life on Earth presents a significant challenge in the cases of metazoan microbiomes and colonial/symbiotic organisms (Daniels et al., 2016). In addition to evolved/natural Agents, the field of artificial intelligence has (or soon will) give rise to numerous constructs that may represent kinds of Selves. The goal then is not to attempt to draw a sharp line but to understand the factors that go into empirically useful ways to demarcate Individuals in a given context.\n\nThe question of defining an \"organism” has been long discussed in biology (Huxley, 1852; Loeb, 1916, 1937; Sober, 1991; Maynard Smith and Szathmáry, 1995; West et al., 2015). Much work has been done on defining compound Individuals, from perspectives of evolution (the forces which drive long-term changes in the parts and how they relate), game theory (competition between and within the parts), thermodynamics and dissipative systems, systems theory, and even immunology (Prigogine, 1980; Rosen, 1985; Pradeu and Carosella, 2006; Strassmann and Queller, 2010; Pradeu, 2012, 2016; Godfrey-Smith, 2016, 2017). Below, I first present some background on aspects of flexible decision-making at different levels of biological organization and then argue for a definition based on information and goal-directedness (Walker et al., 2016) from a developmental biology perspective. I suggest candidates for proximate mechanisms that drive major transitions and provide a plausible evolutionary story of how primitive homeostasis leads to advanced agency (Man and Damasio, 2019). This perspective is complementary to others, not incompatible with them. There is likely more than one useful definition of what constitutes a cognitive agent, in terms of making predictions and optimizing control policies for the origin and behavior of specific agents in various circumstances. As will be seen below, the information-centered definition of the Self has specific advantages for dealing with nested (multi-scale) structures observed in the biosphere and for understanding the shifting (not fixed) boundaries between Self and environment that can change within the timeline of a single individual (not only on evolutionary timescales).",

    "text": "[PAGE 4] BODY PATTERNING AND COGNITION: A COMMON ORIGIN\n\n\"Our life is shaped by our mind; we become what we think.\" Gautama Buddha\n\nIt is a well-known fact that the biosphere is a set of nesting dolls (Smythies, 2015). Eco-systems consist of groups that are comprised of organisms, which in turn are made of organs composed of tissues, which consist of cells made up of biochemical networks.\n\nRemarkably, flexible and adaptive behavior is found at every level, which provides an important background for thinking about scale-invariant, essential features of Individuals in the broadest sense. Do integrated Selves only exist at the level of \"organisms\" (bodies), or could they arise and co-exist at multiple levels of organization and be recognized in novel contexts and implementations? In preparation for a proposed definition of Selves as goal-directed computational agents regardless of embodiment, it is helpful to begin by considering novel embodiments of capacities usually associated with brains.\n\nSingle cells are composite agents that exhibit extremely rich patterning and behaviors and can be divided into even smaller independent units (such as cytoplast fragments with autonomous activity) because of their dynamic cytoskeletal and protein network subsystems (Novák and Bentrup, 1972; Albrecht-Buehler, 1985; Ford, 2017; Siccardi and Adamatzky, 2017; Barvitenko et al., 2018; Graham et al., 2018). These capacities of cells presage their swarm behavior as metazoan organisms (Gregg, 1959). Most features observed in the anatomical control of complex organisms, including differentiation (Sogabe et al., 2019), plasticity (Koch et al., 2017), programmed cell death (Gordeeva et al., 2004), regenerative repair (Morgan, 1901), and \"neural\" machinery (Tasneem et al., 2005; Liebeskind et al., 2011; Burkhardt, 2015) already existed in ancient, unicellular life forms. Cells such as bacteria and yeast, as well as advanced plants, have been studied for their ability to compute and predict future events using patterns inferred from prior experiences (Saigusa et al., 2008; Pezzulo and Castelfranchi, 2009; Stepp, 2009; Shemesh et al., 2010; Stepp and Turvey, 2010; Mossbridge et al., 2012; Dhar et al., 2013; Goel and Mehta, 2013; Bohm et al., 2016; De Berker et al., 2016; Katz and Springer, 2016; Peters et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2017; Gagliano et al., 2018; Katz et al., 2018). Such aneural systems have also been used to understand neural function (Koshland, 1983; Morimoto and Koshland, 1991; Sarto-Jackson and Tomaska, 2016). Thus, capacities usually assigned to Individuals with nervous systems, such as integrating spatio-temporal information, memory, and ability to pursue specific outcomes via selection from a number of possible behaviors evolved from far older pre-neural origins (Eisenstein, 1975; Boisseau et al., 2016).\n\nThe emerging field known as “basal cognition\" tracks the evolutionary history of learning and decision-making processes, beginning from the dynamic problem-solving capacities of cellular and subcellular forms (Lyon, 2006, 2015; Ginsburg et al., 2019). Many examples of memory, anticipation, context-dependent decision-making, and learning are exhibited by organisms from yeast and bacteria to plants and somatic cells [reviewed in (Lyon, 2006, 2015; Baluška and Levin, 2016)]. This is even true of subcellular-level components, e.g., gene-regulatory networks can execute similar learning and computational properties as neural networks, as can cytoskeletal networks, cell signaling pathways, reaction-diffusion chemistry, and metabolic networks (Watson et al., 2010; Szabó et al., 2012; Stockwell et al., 2015; Prentice-Mott et al., 2016; Dent, 2017; Stovold and O'Keefe, 2017; Barvitenko et al., 2018; Gabalda-Sagarra et al., 2018; Bulcha et al., 2019). Single cells are very good at managing their morphology, behavior, and physiology as needed for survival, altering their motility, and metabolism in response to, and proactively in, changing environmental conditions. They succeed in exploiting their microenvironment toward optimal reproduction by selecting among numerous possible choices of gene expression patterns and behaviors. While the mechanisms by which unicellular organisms' ability to accomplish specific adaptive ends is harnessed toward cooperative multicellularity is still poorly understood, one thing is clear: somatic cells did not lose their behavioral plasticity and computational capabilities in becoming part of metazoan swarms (bodies): they scaled them to enable pursuit of larger goals consisting of creation and upkeep of massively complex anatomies (Pezzulo and Levin, 2015).",

    "text": "[PAGE 4] Metazoan embryos are possible because the progeny of a fertilized egg cell can cooperate to create an invariant, large, complex anatomical structure with very high fidelity. Crucially, this is not simply an emergent result of hardwired processes but a very plastic, context-dependent system that achieves invariant patterning outcomes in an uncertain world. Regulative development (e.g., the two normal bodies resulting when an early embryo is cut in half) reveals that cellular swarms are able to achieve the same desired end-state (a species-specific target morphology) despite drastic perturbations and highly unexpected starting states. For example, when tadpoles are perturbed in the laboratory such that their craniofacial organs are in abnormal positions, they still make largely normal frog faces because eyes, jaws, and other structures move around in unnatural paths and only stop when a \"correct frog face configuration\" is reached (Vandenberg et al., 2012; Pinet and McLaughlin, 2019). Similarly, salamander tails grafted to the flank slowly remodel into limbs - a structure more compatible with the large-scale anatomical spec of a salamander (Farinella-Ferruzza, 1956). Many animals, such as axolotls, are able to regenerate whole limbs, no matter where they are amputated, and other organs; a key aspect is that the new appendages grow until the precisely correct structures are made - no more and no less. Developing kidneys will form tubules of the same diameter, whether by cell-cell communication of ~10 cells per cross-section in normal settings or by cytoskeletal bending of single cells around themselves when cell size is artificially increased drastically, revealing the ability of the system to harness diverse molecular mechanisms toward the same anatomical outcome (Fankhauser, 1945). These are but a few of the ubiquitous examples of remodeling toward an invariant end. They reveal the ability of somatic cells to not only pursue specific target morphologies despite perturbations and novel scenarios, but to pursue collective patterning outcomes that are truly enormous with respect to the scale of size and organization of single cells: the length of a limb or the configuration of a face are simply not defined at the level of single cells - the set points of pattern-homeostatic mechanisms implemented by a cellular collective are large, organ-level macrostates.\n\nAlso important to the understanding of compound biological individuals is the ability of cells to make decisions as a single coherent unit. For example, in early embryos, regions on the left and right sides of the midline need to express left- or right-specific genes in order to establish invariant laterality of the heart and visceral organs. Experimental interference with a number of physiological mechanisms upstream of asymmetric gene expression is sufficient to randomize this normally invariant pattern, producing duplicated (LL or RR) or reversed (RL) patterns. Remarkably, however, this randomization is made on a group level - in each case, the entire domain randomly picks L or R identity, not exhibiting a speckled appearance where each cell adopts a stochastic outcome. The decision is random, but all of the cells in the domain are coordinated to make the same random decision (Levin et al., 2002). This is likewise seen in the conversion of normal frog pigment cells to melanoma - the decision to convert is stochastic across a population of animals, but it is made by all of the melanocytes within a body acting as a single coherent deciding unit (Lobikin et al., 2015). The ability of cells to join into domains that execute group decisions, whether deterministic or stochastic, is an essential component of the evolution of complex forms and will be a central component of a proposed definition of a Self.",

    "text": "[PAGE 5] The empirical utility of pursuing metaphors based on the parallels between adaptive whole organism behavior and the plasticity of cellular activity during construction and repair of a body is discussed in detail elsewhere (Pezzulo and Levin, 2015). However, for the proposed view of agency described below, and for thinking about its evolutionary origin, it is important to realize that the parallels between goal-directed behaviors and morphogenesis are not only functional but reflect deep conservation of molecular mechanisms. Neural networks control the movement of a body in three-dimensional space; this scheme may be an evolutionary exaptation and speed-optimization of a more ancient, slower role of bioelectrical signaling: the movement of body configuration through anatomical morphospace during embryogenesis, repair, and remodeling (Sullivan et al., 2016; Mathews and Levin, 2018; McLaughlin and Levin, 2018). This is an expansion of previous proposals of minimal cognition as sensorimotor coordination (Van Duijn et al., 2006), to include cell behavior during morphogenesis as a kind of sensorimotor activity of a patterning Agent.\n\nDevelopmental bioelectricity is the ubiquitous exchange of slowly changing ion-based voltage signals within and among cells (Funk, 2013; Levin and Martyniuk, 2018). All cells are electrically active, and modern neurons evolved from pre-neural precursors that were already reaping the benefits of ionic signaling for computation. How ancient are these mechanisms - how early was bioelectric coordination exploited by evolution? Bioelectric dynamics, already used for coordination within bacterial biofilms (Prindle et al., 2015), also enable embryonic tissues to implement robust growth and morphogenesis (Bates, 2015), as well as by unicellular organisms to coordinate behavior (Van Houten, 1979). Recent advances in developmental bioelectricity have shown how endogenous dynamics of resting potential changes modify transcriptional cascades and thereby instruct axial patterning, organ determination, and size control, as well as guiding the behavior of individual cells (Sundelacruz et al., 2009; Levin, 2014; Levin and Martyniuk, 2018). It is thus not surprising that drugs that modify traditional cognitive capacities can be strong teratogens (Hernandez-Diaz and Levin, 2014), while anesthetics reduce and modify regenerative capacity (Buchanan, 1922; Tseng et al., 2010). We have previously argued that the deep evolutionary conservation of ion channel and neurotransmitter mechanisms highlights a fundamental isomorphism between developmental and behavioral processes. Consistent with this, membrane excitability has been suggested to be the ancestral basis for psychology (Grossberg, 1978; Cook et al., 2014; Pezzulo and Levin, 2015). Thus, it is likely that the cognitive capacities of advanced brains lie on a continuum with, and evolve from, much simpler computational processes that are widely conserved at both the functional and mechanism (molecular) levels. The information processing and spatio-temporal integration needed to construct and regenerate complex bodies arises from the capabilities of single cells, which evolution exapted and scaled up as behavioral repertoires of complex nervous systems that underlie familiar examples of Selves. An appreciation of these aspects of developmental biology blurs the distinction between mind and body - a direction already being explored in the field of soft body robotics (Pfeifer et al., 2007a,b; Pfeifer and Gomez, 2009), which expands the possibilities for defining new kinds of Selves. A computational perspective on the task of building specific complex anatomies suggests interesting new ways to think about how an integrated Self can be formed and how its boundaries are maintained or altered during its lifetime and within evolutionary timescales.",

    "text": "[PAGE 6] MULTICELLULARITY VS. CANCER: THE SHIFTING BOUNDARY OF THE SELF\n\nThe communication that enables cells to join into collectives that make decisions about the growth and form of organ-level structures (i.e., what to sculpt and when to stop) can go awry, resulting in cancer (Chernet and Levin, 2013a; Moore et al., 2017). Despite highly diverse molecular and clinical manifestations, one common aspect points to the key: in carcinogenic transformation (Yamasaki et al., 1995; Ruch and Trosko, 2001), cells become isolated from the physiological signals that bind them into unified networks (the essential role of bioelectricity in this process is discussed in the next section). In the absence of global cues, they revert to their unicellular past, when their behaviors were aimed at optimizing the future of just one cell: proliferate as much as possible, and travel to whatever location affords the best local environment for nutrients and expansion (Davies and Lineweaver, 2011; Bussey et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018a). This is a breakdown of multicellularity and highlights the fact that the scale of the structure which cells work to maintain can change rapidly - from cooperation toward an entire organ system or body to the level of a single cell.\n\nNormal bodies consist of networks of cells working together toward a unified goal - create and maintain specific large structures. In an important sense, each cell is integrated, via physiological signaling, into a coherent swarm intelligence with system-level (anatomical) goals. In cancer, the scope of the coherent Self of a cell reduces from being as large as the boundary of a whole body, to that of just one cell's surface. The scope of the Self – the structure which a cell works to maintain and support - shrinks drastically in two main ways. First, it shrinks spatially: being electrically isolated from their neighbors by a shutdown of gap junction synapses, a cell can neither measure distant events nor communicate across anatomical distances with other cells and with the outside world (Kull, 2000; Ay and Lohr, 2015). All of the attention (in terms of measurement and activity toward scaled goals) is focused at the single cell level, while the rest of the body is treated as the “external environment” (and all living things exploit their environment for their own benefit). Thus, the boundary between self and non-self (David Krakauer et al., 2014) can shift: multicellularity enlarges it, while carcinogenesis reduces it, and it is readily seen how this shifts the behavior of cells toward a mode that is not beneficial for the organism level. Moreover, the size of the Self shrinks temporally: the time horizon of activity shifts from decades (somatic cells execute regenerative and repair processes that maintain a body up to ~100 years) to a much shorter time frame, as cancer cells undertake activity which may kill the host (and themselves) within a mere year. Normal cells pursue goals (organ maintenance) that can be much longer than a cell's individual lifespan, especially in tissues with rapid cellular turnover - the time scale for such homeostatic activity is one that belongs to the collective, not the cells themselves. Shrinking their Self reduces the ability to work toward temporally distant goals (reduces their temporal horizon of concern) and, together with the inability to communicate as part of a distributed electrical network, makes them literally short-sighted - undertaking activity that will result in death of themselves as well as of the organism (except in the very rare cases of transmissible tumors). This view predicts that interference with (or restoration of) physiological communication among cells should be able to trigger (or suppress) cancer and that the relevant parameter (communication) is spread out over considerable distance and not confined to single cells (e.g., genomic damage). The general fact that actively patterning (embryonic and regenerative) environments can reprogram cancer cells to normal histogenesis has been known for decades (Illmensee and Mintz, 1976; Kasemeier-Kulesa et al., 2008; Oviedo and Beane, 2009). However, the specific prediction of a role of real-time bioelectric communication in cancer has been confirmed in vivo in recent experiments: metastatic transformation of normal melanocytes can be achieved in genetically normal tadpoles simply by depolarizing a specific cell population (Lobikin et al., 2012), while, conversely, human oncogenes which normally induce tumors can be prevented from doing so simply by optogenetic or constitutive hyperpolarization (Chernet and Levin, 2013b, 2014; Chernet et al., 2015, 2016).",

    "text": "One important aspect should be stressed, in connection with the classic evolutionary concept of \"selfishness\" (Werren, 2011; Kourilsky, 2012): on the above-mentioned view, the cells in a metazoan organism body are not less selfish than unicellular organisms or cancer cells. They are equally selfish, working only for the benefit of themselves, but the relevant self that they defend is bigger in terms of space, time, and complexity. As will be argued below, what defines this Self is the boundary of information being able to pass between the subunits. It should be noted that this change is not binary and can occur at intermediate levels, e.g., teratoma tumors have coherent differentiated tissues (teeth, hair, skin, and muscle) but are not functional embryos, illustrating a level of integrated organization between that of cells and whole organs. It is an essential aspect of Scale-Free Cognition that most biological systems consist of multiple, nested selves [not one, as implied by Integrated Information Theory (Tononi, 2008)]. Each inner agent maintains its own local Self only to the extent that it regulates (restricts) information flow from neighbors and thus establishes unique states that do not coincide with those of the collective. Evolutionary and game-like dynamics occur within and between each level of organization, via cooperation and competition. While competition between cells in a body is only now beginning to be characterized in molecular detail (Gogna et al., 2015), the remarkable fact that different substructures in an otherwise unified organism do not all have the same goals and can work at cross-purposes was realized already at the very dawn of developmental biology by Roux, who presciently wrote of the struggle of the parts in an embryo (Heams, 2012).\n\nSome biologists model cancer cells as individuals, while some see a tumor as its own organ (Egeblad et al., 2010), which can take over other cell types (Gabrilovich, 2017) in the same way that embryonic instructor cells control others in normal development (Vieira and McCusker, 2019). These possibilities could now be distinguished experimentally and analytically using advances in information theory that enable rigorous comparison of the causal power of models at different levels of description (Hoel et al., 2013, 2016; Moore et al., 2017). Identifying the most efficacious level of organization in a given system is critical for selecting targets in biomedical or engineering approaches to understand and control it. Is the best strategy chemotherapy, which seeks to identify and destroy irrevocably broken cells, or could there be normalization strategies that re-connect cells into a collective? The latter is a tantalizing possibility, as it has long been known that embryonic or regenerative environments can reprogram tumors in situ (Mintz and Illmensee, 1975; Kulesa et al., 2006). Motivating a system with inputs and experiences at the appropriate level is always easier than attempting to rewire complex systems with emergent dynamics in attempts to micromanage specific global outcomes. Understanding the decision-making, not only the molecular mechanisms, is essential and is perhaps one path toward resolving the unsatisfactory state of cancer medicine (Soto and Sonnenschein, 2013; Sonnenschein and Soto, 2015). Similar approaches are being taken with respect to swarms of insects, robots, and human beings (Couzin, 2009; Deisboeck and Couzin, 2009; Gomes et al., 2013; Rubenstein et al., 2014).",

    "text": "[PAGE 7] The ability of subunits to enter into a communication network with variable scale of boundaries is already being recognized in swarm dynamics, where the termite nest \"superorganism is marked by a kind of extended physiology\", which supports regenerative repair (taking the large termite nest as the \"body\"), a kind of swarm cancer, and primitive cognition functions such as hypothesis testing carried out by the swarm during the repair process (Beekman and Oldroyd, 2008; Turner, 2016). As will be seen in the next section, this continuum between somatic pattern and cognitive systems reflects a deep scale invariance of cognitive concepts that apply as much to societies of cells as of societies of animals (Seeley, 2009; Turner, 2011). The view of the extent of active information as central to demarcating what exactly constitutes an Individual Self in a given context, especially the focus on a set of level-specific goal states that a system is able to pursue, suggests a formalism for identifying, categorizing, and comparing highly diverse types of Individuals.\n\nDEFINING INDIVIDUATION FROM A COGNITIVE PERSPECTIVE\n\n\"By the term \"mind,” I mean ideas and purposes.\" -McCulloch, 1951\n\nI propose a definition of an Individual based on its information-processing structure (Barandiaran et al., 2009): the scale and types of goals that a system can pursue defines (determines) the boundaries and content of the putative “agent.” On this view, what defines a coherent, unified Self out of its constituent components and the surrounding environment is the set of parts that operate toward reaching specific goal states. Like a theorem, which has a holistic nature not shared by any of the axioms alone, a functional individual is more than the sum of its parts in the sense that goal-directed capacity emerges only from the integrated activity of all of the components (Weiss, 1967). This flows naturally from the conception of a goal-seeking system: having specified goal state(s), it is immediately clear than there must be an integrated system that can perform all of the parts of the Test-Operate-Test cycle, which may be invisible by inspecting each of the components in micro detail. This definition is orthogonal to other definitions, e.g., evolutionary or genetic ones, but having bigger goals (such as organ morphogenesis instead of single-cell proliferation) de-Darwinises cells and Darwinises groups, shifting the locus of selection and competition (Michod, 2007; Godfrey-Smith, 2009). I propose a working definition for the degree to which a system is a coherent Self, in terms of the goals (in the cybernetic sense) that the system seeks to achieve. Thus, a system's ability to operate toward specific counterfactuals (future states that are not true right now but can be brought about through specific actions) is central to defining, understanding, and communicating with an arbitrary Individual, which might consist of many levels of organized components. Complex cognitive systems can have very large and multifaceted goals, and this arises through evolutionary and ontogenetic scale-up and elaboration of primitive goals that arose from constraints of thermodynamics and homeostasis. The initial, most primitive feature of a living system is preferences - the fact that some states of the world are better for its welfare than others. This enables learning from positive and negative reinforcement, which leads to an explosion of computational and behavioral capabilities. Preferences evolve into goals to the extent that a system grows in complexity and causal power and becomes able to act in the world in ways that are likely to move it toward preferred regions of its state space (initially, focused on simple metabolic survival, but ranging all the way to complex human psychological needs and perhaps beyond). It is likely that any life we observe today (which has passed the filter of selection) has preferences and is good at optimizing for them (making this criterion a useful part of the very definition of life), but it is possible that our initial efforts at artificial life may construct some truly primitive, transitional cases that can maintain a degree of coherence in a sheltered laboratory environment without an efficient goal-seeking capacity.",

In this perspective, we discuss general bioenergetic principles of life transitions and the costly molecular processes involved in reprogramming the cellular hardware/software as cells shift identity. The energetic cost of cellular differentiation has not been directly quantified, representing a gap in knowledge.

For this reason, any type of change must consume energy. In other words, change costs energy. But living cells and organisms constantly face the need for change, including energetically costly transitions from one cellular state to another, or from one position to another within the organism [1]. Bearing adequate resources, all developing cells and subpopulations of adult cells must, at some point, transition from their relatively undifferentiated pluripotent identity to some \"terminal\" specialized identity. Therefore, understanding the core subcellular mechanisms that monitor a cell's energetic status and that also energetically sustain their challenging life transitions, has the potential to uncover biological principles that are the basis of human health, or that falter in diseases.",

    "text": "Life transitions and identity changes are always difficult. This principle applies across levels of complexity: molecules rearrange or break down via endergonic chemical reactions, pluripotent cells transition from a stem-like state into a terminally differentiated identity, and complex conscious organisms are forced to transition from one developmental life stage to another [2]. The difficulty with transitions likely emerges from the activation energy barriers that must be overcome to achieve change (Fig. 1). In the same way that many enzymes require activation energy (e.g., ATP, NAD(P)H, and others) to power the molecular transition of substrate A into product B, the human mind and body require inputting energy to power all meaningful life transitions. For instance, major life transitions such as moving into a new home or changing one's social relationship(s) all come with some degree of uncontrollability, leading to psychobiological stress [3]. The neuroendocrine stress responses engendered by the resulting uncomfortable psychological states consume considerable amounts of energy [4]. As a result, major life and organismal transitions must be energetically costly. The most energetically costly period of human life—where whole-body energy expenditure normalized per unit of body mass is the highest—is between ages 1 and 15 [5]. This period is replete with changes as the infant develops an identity as a child and later transitions into adolescence and adulthood. Over this critical life stage, the body undergoes phases of rapid growth and biomass accumulation, as well as pruning and establishing billions of neural connections. In parallel, major psychobiological changes must occur as personality and the ego or \"I\" develop, occurring alongside life-defining anatomical, physiological, and hormonal changes (Fig. 2a, top). Interestingly, this costly developmental transition through adolescence is marked by the highest risk of onset for mental health disorders [7]. The individual vulnerability around this period of high energy demand suggests that competing demands for limited energetic resources could interfere with developmental processes, resilience, and health [8]. Below, we focus our discussion on life transitions at the cellular level. Similar to human life transitions, cellular maturation and identity changes operate under the same principles and face similarly costly challenges. But, cellular transitions occur at a scale amenable to the scientific scalpel of molecular biology and the precise mechanistic dissection it affords. Thus, understanding the energetic principles that guide these processes may yield new insights into the energetic forces and molecular pathways that monitor and constrain differentiation.",

    "text": "One of the hallmarks of multicellular organisms is that the activity of individual cells is harnessed toward broader organismal goals. This includes creating complex anatomical structures and morphologies (i.e., morphospace) [9]. Starting from the fertilized egg, all descendants of that cell must differentiate, migrate, and cooperate with each other to eventually reach the possible region with configurations that correspond to the normal species-specific anatomy. Yet, after differentiation, cells keep changing and adapting in response to environmental cues. They are constantly actively monitoring their state, computing errors from their final position and function, and working to reduce those errors [10-12]. These energy-consuming actions require reprogrammability.\nWhile genomes encode the specific hardware that each cell has access to (via the proteins specified by the DNA sequence and chromatin state), the behavior of each cell and the cell collective is driven by the physiological software that supervenes on the hardware [13, 14]. Note that the hardware-software analogy used here and in synthetic bioengineering and evolutionary developmental biology [15-17] refers not to the anthropomorphic origin of some (but no longer all [18]) software but rather refers to the fact that the exact same hardware (genomically determined cellular components) can give rise to numerous different outcomes. Just like the same physical computer hardware can run or execute vastly different software (text processing, video streaming, etc.).\nA cell's hardware includes the proteins encoded by the sequences of its genome that are epigenetically \"open\" and active or \"closed\" and repressed, plus the complex set of organelles, proteins, and molecules it contains at any given time [19]. The cell's software includes the program(s) executed by the hardware, which comprise biomechanical [20-22], bioelectrical [23-25], and transcriptional [26-28] dynamics.",

Each of these programmable biological layers can process information, store memories, and interact with other layers.

For example, each active gene comes at a substantial energetic cost [34]. The hardware of a differentiating cell is altered by actively repressing and silencing specific genes, while others are opened and transcribed. This gives rise to new proteins that must be energetically synthesized (4 ATP molecules per amino acid [35]), while others are actively degraded or secreted. The cell's software is also reprogrammed by increasing or decreasing the resting plasma membrane potential, tweaking connections to surrounding cells, migrating, reconfiguring cytoplasmic constituents, and other non-random changes [23]. Thus, as cell fate transitions change a cell's molecular identity—as well as its role within the organism—it requires widespread energy input to reprogram both the cellular hardware and software. As a result, reprogramming and cell fate transitions may represent one of the most stressful and energetically costly events that a cell has to go through.",

    "text": "As introduced above, stress responses necessarily cost energy [4]. The term \"stress\" refers to any type of response that catalyzes change within a complex system, such as a transition from state Y to Z (e.g., resting to activated). Stress is often caused by external \"stressors\" that force a cell or organism to adapt and change its state. But stress is also triggered by internal processes, like a developmental trajectory that requires a cell to shift identity [36] or by the accumulation of damage during aging [37, 38].\nImportantly, the costs of stress and other processes are generally cumulative. This means that the energy required to power hardware/software reprogramming during cellular transitions must come on top of what is required at baseline to prevent entropy and sustain life [39]. Thus, while a developing cell naturally expends energy to maintain integrity, it also must deploy energetically expensive molecular processes required to shift its identity toward its terminal state, adding to the energetic cost of life.\nBut, living systems possess a finite capacity to transform energy [40]. The interplay of limited energetic capacity with the competing demands of molecular processes leads to energy constraints both within cells [41] and organisms [42]. The limited energy budget means that not all cellular or physiological systems can be turned on at the same time. Moreover, some transformations are also not compatible and must be separated in time (e.g., catabolic and anabolic pathways). Therefore, by necessity and to preserve efficiency in a given physiological context, one state must be dominant over other ones.\nConsequently, an evolutionarily-driven hierarchy of energy needs dictates which molecular system is prioritized over another one. For example, cells must prioritize the maintenance of vital membrane potential through ion pumps, and of protein synthesis by ribosomes, over the more acutely dispensable DNA and RNA synthesis by polymerases [43]. Similarly, at the scale of the mammalian body, blood flow to the so-called \"vital\" organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and kidneys is prioritized over digestive and connective tissues, particularly in times of (real or perceived) stress. Energy is a vital resource, distributed sparingly and economically between and within living cells.",

    "text": "Aerobic mammalian cells derive most of their usable energy from the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system within mitochondria. The OxPhos system pulls and reacts hydrocarbon-derived electrons with oxygen to build a transmembrane charge that powers ATP synthesis. For this reason, mitochondria naturally play a permissive role in sustaining life and enabling all psychobiological life transitions [44]. By producing ATP on demand—that is, when ATP is hydrolyzed into ADP and inorganic phosphate—mitochondria essentially \"keep the lights on\", enabling life's vital operations. But an important question is whether beyond its permissive role, energy transformation by mitochondrial OxPhos also plays an instructive role in shaping major cellular transitions, including differentiation from a stem-like precursor cell type to a terminally differentiated state. It is well recognized that by controlling apoptosis, mitochondria dictate the ultimate death transition [45, 46]. We also know that terminal cell differentiation across cell lineages and contexts acutely depends on [47-49] and is even temporally controlled [50, 51] by mitochondrial redox and metabolite signaling, fusion-fission dynamics, and energetics [52-56]. Thus, mitochondria unequivocally play an instructive role in contributing to fuel and regulate stressful cellular identity transitions. However, one major outstanding question has persisted around the molecular mechanisms through which mitochondrial OxPhos defects are transduced to the nucleus, via so-called \"retrograde signaling\". We recently reported that primary human fibroblasts with OxPhos defects—which exhibit nuclear stress responses—expend up to twice as much energy to stay alive under resting conditions [57]. OxPhos defects increase the cost of living, or energy expenditure, likely through multiple cellular, tissue-level, and physiological stress response mechanisms that promote hypermetabolism [58]. Similarly, glucocorticoid signaling alone (which is not intrinsically damaging) in primary fibroblasts also induces an \"anticipatory\" stress response that increases cellular energy expenditure by ~60% [59]. Based on the economy of cellular energy outlined above, the cost of stress responses may expectedly conflict with the energetic requirements of differentiation, as observed in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells where OxPhos defects interfered with cellular differentiation [60]. How are the competing energetic demands of responding to intrinsically stressful OxPhos defects reconciled with the energetic requirements of cell fate transition? Might energetic stress responses and cell fate transitions be incompatible? If they are incompatible, might this explain developmental failure and pathogenesis in animal models of OxPhos defects and patients with mitochondrial diseases?",

    "text": "Recent research combining cell-type-specific genetic mitochondrial lesions, small-molecule inhibitors, and single-cell resolution mapping of cellular states in mice sheds light on the intersection of mitochondrial OxPhos defects and developmental cell fate transition [6]. In the study by Han et al., pulmonary alveolar cells with a defect in the mitochondrial OxPhos complex I subunit NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur protein 2 (Ndufs2) failed to transition toward their terminal identity, ultimately leading to respiratory failure and death. Importantly, transitioning cells employ a molecular mechanism acting as a checkpoint that inhibits a specific cell fate transition required for survival. This work raises several significant questions discussed below. In a healthy lung, a population of partially committed alveolar epithelial stem cells (AT2) transitions to alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) cells, which transfer oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide from the blood to support respiration. Perturbing mitochondrial OxPhos complex I in this cell lineage prevented AT2 cells from acquiring their terminal AT1 identity [6]. Importantly, complex I deficiency did not prevent cellular transition by promoting stemness but rather by triggering a shift toward a \"transitional\" state somewhere between the AT2 and AT1 cellular states (Fig. 2a, bottom). The differentiation failure was neither driven by forced quiescence nor senescence, as OxPhos-deficient lungs had increased expression of the proliferation marker Ki67, although the transitional cell population was mildly positive for the senescence marker cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Cdkn1a) [6]. As transitional states involve extensive hardware and software remodeling, the \"identity crisis\" of transitional cells must bear substantial energetic costs to the cell. However, reliable data quantifying the energetic costs of cell fate transitions appear to be lacking in the literature, representing a major gap in knowledge. Nevertheless, cells naturally strive to acquire energetically \"stable\" or optimal states [36]. Under physiological conditions, driven by energy constraints, very few cells exist in such \"unstable\" and likely costly transitional states. This is confirmed by single-cell RNA sequencing datasets where transitional cells are rare (< 1%) occurrences [6]. Nevertheless, both in developing lung tissue and in injured lungs, naturally occurring transitional cells upregulate a key transcriptional stress pathway called the integrated stress response (ISR) [6, 61] (Fig. 2a, bottom). Thus, during normal development, transitional cells show evidence of stress in general and activation of ISR in particular.",

    "text": "The ISR, sometimes referred to as the mitochondrial ISR (ISRmt), is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular signaling network triggered in response to several environmental and cell-intrinsic stressors, including but not limited to nutrient deprivation, infections, misfolded proteins, and oxidative stresses [61, 62]. Upon stress signaling, phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) signals through CHOP [CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homology protein] (Ddit3) [63] and activating transcription factors Atf4 and Atf5 to upregulate the expression of several downstream genes [61, 64] (Fig. 2b). Other stress signal transduction cascades may also converge on the ISR [65]. The epistatic network of relationships among ISR genes is still being uncovered in different species and cell types. One of the best-described ISR targets, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), is transcribed and secreted into the extracellular space, making its way into the bloodstream to exert broad systemic signaling effects [66]. GDF15 concentration is elevated in the blood of patients with OxPhos defects [67, 68], in the media of cultured cells with genetic or pharmacological OxPhos defects [57], as well as under other metabolically challenging situations including pregnancy [69] and starvation [70]—making GDF15 a putative general marker of \"energetic stress\". Another ISR target, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), is also systemically upregulated in human and animal mitochondrial OxPhos defects, where it contributes to systemic ISR signaling [71]. The ISR-GDF15 axis appears to act as a metabolic stress signaling network, which among other roles may exist to inform the brain of energetic/redox stress among somatic tissues [66]. Yet, the factors by which mitochondrial OxPhos defects engage the ISR in vivo, in different tissues and cell types, remain to be fully elucidated. In mice, the ISR is triggered in affected tissues by mitochondrial OxPhos defects [64, 65, 72]. However, different OxPhos defects can trigger the ISR through different mechanisms [73, 74]. In addition, non-OxPhos mitochondrial stressors can also induce the ISR, including misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix [75, 76] and iron deficiency via the mitochondrial death ligand signal enhancer 1 (DELE1) [77], indicating that several triggers and molecular pathways act upstream of the mitochondrial ISR.",

Most of these genes were induced at levels above the expression levels naturally induced in healthy transitional lung epithelial cells, suggesting that the OxPhos defects tapped into the same pathway. However, in this case, the OxPhos defects amplified this pathway to a point where the ISR became maladaptive or pathological. Both genetic and pharmacological OxPhos defects reliably activate Gdf15 expression in mammalian cells, including in primary human fibroblasts [57]. Interestingly, pathological ISR activation in the developing lung was not driven by ATP deficiency. Rather, it was triggered by reductive stress, reflected by an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio, which is a natural consequence of mitochondrial complex I deficiency. With normal OxPhos function, NADH donates its electron to complex I, oxidizing it back to NAD+. It was previously shown in myoblasts that oxidizing cytosolic NADH to NAD+ is sufficient to prevent ISR activation in complex I-deficient cells [73]. Recent work also confirmed that selectively inducing NADH reductive stress, without OxPhos deficiency, is sufficient to activate the ISR [78]. Han et al. extended these findings to the in vivo developing lung as they demonstrated that alleviating reductive stress by enzymatically oxidizing NADH prevented pathological alveolar ISR activation, thereby normalizing lung development [6]. Complex I-deficient mice protected from cytoplasmic reductive stress by overexpression of the yeast NADH dehydrogenase Ndi1 developed normally for up to 25 months. In the context of monitoring costly cellular transitions, the NADH/NAD+ ratio is naturally a major driving force. The cellular energy landscape required to sustain stressful and costly transitions involves not only the phosphorylation potential (ATP/ADP/AMP) that powers several enzymatic reactions but also the redox potential (NADH/NAD+) that powers and regulates perhaps an equal, if not larger, number of molecular transitions [79]. The central dependence of so many reactions on NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ ratio may account for why it has evolved perhaps preferentially in some cell types as a sufficient and perhaps most potent trigger of the ISR.",

Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that primary disease-causing mitochondrial OxPhos defects activate the ISR [57, 64, 72, 73, 80], establishing that the ISR is active in non-homeostatic metabolic environments (reviewed in [62]). Upregulated under pathological conditions, the ISR places affected cells into a pro-survival state, likely as an attempt to re-establish cellular homeostasis [61]. Non-essential and costly cellular processes are put on hold (e.g., initial ISR-dependent inhibition of translation), while pro-survival essential processes are upregulated. Direct support for the view that the ISR is \"pathological\" comes from the demonstration that inhibiting the ISR in the presence of the OxPhos complex I defects increases survival. In lung epithelial cells, ISR activation contributes to pathophysiology and mortality [6]. By serving as an inflexible cellular checkpoint, ISR activation in OxPhos-deficient developing alveolar epithelial cells appears to prevent the transition of AT2 cells into AT1 cells, without which the lung is not functional, and animals are not viable (Fig. 2c, left). Similarly, in mice with OxPhos-deficient skeletal muscles caused by mtDNA deletion, deleting FGF21 rescues some aspects of the pathological phenotype, suggesting that secreted ISR products contribute to pathophysiology in mice [71].",

    "text": "A second related developmental proposition is that robust ISR activation evolved to prevent energetically compromised cells from engaging in excessively costly cell fate transitions. Initiating an energetically challenging transition without the assurance that sufficient resources are present could result in cell death, compromising animal survival. This is supported by the complete inhibition of AT2-to-AT1 transition in ISR-induced Ndufs2 knockout cells [6]. Normal developmental or regenerative transitions induce the ISR, but at lower levels that do not inhibit AT2-to-AT1 transitions (Fig. 2c, middle). In this case, the ISR may be triggered to prevent costly cellular commitment that could be fatal, and therefore detrimental to the organism. This dual role of ISR upregulation in cellular differentiation was also demonstrated in a model of a rare genetic skeletal disorder, in which endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress upregulated the ISR in hypertrophic chondrocytes [81]. Also, in this model, ISR-positive cells survived but transitioned back into a \"juvenile\" state. Importantly, Atf4 was also expressed during normal (embryonic) development in differentiating chondrocytes. Inhibiting the ISR rescued skeletal abnormalities but had no impact on normal development of healthy (wild-type) mice [81]. These findings suggest that the ISR may be normally upregulated by default during development, possibly as a way of heightening the cell's sensitivity to potential energetic stress. Supporting this view, other studies suggest that the ISR is activated preceding energetically demanding cellular expansion in activated T lymphocytes [82]. Iron deficiency can also trigger the ISR [83]. Whether stressors other than OxPhos also trigger the ISR to inhibit cell fate transitions remains unclear. More work is needed to understand the role of ISR activation during normal cellular differentiation and embryonic development.",

    "text": "Let us remember that all mammalian nuclear programs and signaling pathways, including the ISR, must have evolved to optimize the fitness of the organism. The organism, not single cells, is the ultimate unit of natural selection. Therefore, we likely will approach the most accurate physiological interpretation of the ISR if we manage to understand its effects beyond the confine of the cell, in the context of the organism. The third potential interpretation is that the ISR is a cellular-level sensor evolved to inform the organism of somatic energetic stress. In animals, ISR-mediated GDF15 secretion from affected tissues, including skeletal muscles [84] and adipocytes [85] appears to contribute to accelerating physiological processes, increasing whole-body energy expenditure [86]. OxPhos-deficient cells produce GDF15 that elevates the rate of energy transformation across the whole organism and likely plays other roles related to energy balance [62]. Intuitively, cells with energy production defects would be expected to adopt or deploy energy conservation strategies. However, as noted above, mitochondrial OxPhos defects increase energy expenditure to produce a state of cellular hypermetabolism [57]. In fact, OxPhos defects cause hyperactive physiology at multiple levels: OxPhos-deficient individuals secrete more catecholamines, have higher resting heart rate, grow more capillaries around OxPhos-deficient myofibers, and produce exaggerated cardiovascular and ventilatory responses to mild physical challenges [58, 87, 88]. Collectively, we can understand these hyperkinetic responses as mechanisms that cooperate to increase energy delivery to OxPhos-deficient, ISR-positive cells, which behave and signal as if energy starved. Based on these facts, we reason that the physiological purpose of these ISR-driven hyperactive systems is to ensure the availability of energy resources (oxygen, carbon substrates) to all cells within the organism. The brain plays a major role in ensuring that cells and organs cooperate toward the same goal—the survival of the organism. Thus, the brain naturally harbors the cognate GDF15 receptor GFRAL (GDNF family receptor α-like) [89], allowing it to sense circulating GDF15, a major endocrine output of the ISR [66]. In mice, GDF15 also appears to recruit the glucose-releasing and hyperglycemia-promoting hormone corticosterone, further mobilizing energetic resources to fuel energy-starved ISR-positive and GDF15-secreting cells and tissues [90]. Thus, cells may use the ISR gene program and its secreted products to call in additional energetic resources from surrounding cells and organs to support them through challenging transitional times (Fig. 2c, right). But in OxPhos-deficient cells, the ISR appears permanently activated, the chronicity of which likely contributes to the pathological effects of the ISR. The true function of the ISR is likely a dynamic combination of these propositions, expressed differently depending on the developmental context, cell type, stress exposure, and metabolic state of the organism.",

    "text": "Life transitions are inherently \"stressful\" because they cost energy. OxPhos defects appear to increase the cost of life in cells, animals, and people [57, 58]. This likely occurs because cells that contain OxPhos-deficient mitochondria must bend their metabolism and behaviors out of shape, forced to induce and utilize less optimal metabolic strategies to survive. But in turn, the costly compensations that actively push them away from their optimal bioenergetic state require activating compensatory stress response pathways. These include but are not limited to the ISR. The ISR itself triggers costly genetic programs leading to metabokine protein synthesis, secretion, cell-cell signaling, and even somato-cognitive (i.e., body-brain) signaling that conveys systemic energetic distress to the brain [66]. Recent research shows that in the context of mitochondrial complex I-related OxPhos defects, the ISR can interfere with and prevent stressful cell fate transitions in mouse lung epithelial cells, resulting in death [6]. Building on previous [73] and recent work [78], the new findings cement the notion that reductive stress (elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio) is a necessary and sufficient ISR trigger in this in vivo context. Importantly, we also learn that normal developmental cell fate transitions involve ISR activation, suggesting that the ISR is a physiologically meaningful rheostat of stress signaling induced as part of normal, albeit challenging, cellular life transitions. Each cell must operate as an information processing system monitoring its capacity to engage in costly life transitions. The new single-cell molecular details around ISR biology [6], interpreted through the lens of an economy of energy [39, 42, 91], suggests that the ISR is a central circuit of the cellular and mitochondrial information processing system [92] that weighs bioenergetic demand and supply. But several questions arise. Does the ISR play the same \"checkpoint\" role in all cell types, across species? At the scale of an individual, do stressful and energetically costly lifespan psychobiological transitions also trigger the ISR or other energy monitoring pathways to steer the organism toward the most optimal path to adaptation? Can our understanding of ISR biology be harnessed to assist cells and individuals in reaching their full developmental and health potential? Mitochondrial stress signaling is a burgeoning field replete with inspiring questions heavy with health implications. Addressing these questions across scales of complexity—from organelle to organism—requires that we integrate molecular energy sensing mechanisms within the brain-body and psychobiological systems that shape development and aging trajectories. Increasingly precise technologies and versatile approaches to probe stress responses across time and space make this a particularly exciting time for biology. Our ability to leverage new technologies informed by bioenergetic principles promises to produce increasingly more accurate models of health and development.",

Bearing adequate resources, all developing cells and subpopulations of adult cells must, at some point, transition from their relatively undifferentiated pluripotent identity to some \"terminal\" specialized identity.

This principle applies across levels of complexity: molecules rearrange or break down via endergonic chemical reactions, pluripotent cells transition from a stem-like state into a terminally differentiated identity, and complex conscious organisms are forced to transition from one developmental life stage to another [2]. The difficulty with transitions likely emerges from the activation energy barriers that must be overcome to achieve change (Fig. 1). In the same way that many enzymes require activation energy (e.g., ATP, NAD(P)H, and others) to power the molecular transition of substrate A into product B, the human mind and body require inputting energy to power all meaningful life transitions. For instance, major life transitions such as moving into a new home or changing one's social relationship(s) all come with some degree of uncontrollability, leading to psychobiological stress [3]. The neuroendocrine stress responses engendered by the resulting uncomfortable psychological states consume considerable amounts of energy [4].

Over this critical life stage, the body undergoes phases of rapid growth and biomass accumulation, as well as pruning and establishing billions of neural connections. In parallel, major psychobiological changes must occur as personality and the ego or \"I\" develop, occurring alongside life-defining anatomical, physiological, and hormonal changes (Fig. 2a, top). Interestingly, this costly developmental transition through adolescence is marked by the highest risk of onset for mental health disorders [7]. The individual vulnerability around this period of high energy demand suggests that competing demands for limited energetic resources could interfere with developmental processes, resilience, and health [8]. Below, we focus our discussion on life transitions at the cellular level. Similar to human life transitions, cellular maturation and identity changes operate under the same principles and face similarly costly challenges. But, cellular transitions occur at a scale amenable to the scientific scalpel of molecular biology and the precise mechanistic dissection it affords. Thus, understanding the energetic principles that guide these processes may yield new insights into the energetic forces and molecular pathways that monitor and constrain differentiation.",

    "text": "As introduced above, stress responses necessarily cost energy [4]. The term \"stress\" refers to any type of response that catalyzes change within a complex system, such as a transition from state Y to Z (e.g., resting to activated). Stress is often caused by external \"stressors\" that force a cell or organism to adapt and change its state. But stress is also triggered by internal processes, like a developmental trajectory that requires a cell to shift identity [36] or by the accumulation of damage during aging [37, 38].\nImportantly, the costs of stress and other processes are generally cumulative. This means that the energy required to power hardware/software reprogramming during cellular transitions must come on top of what is required at baseline to prevent entropy and sustain life [39]. Thus, while a developing cell naturally expends energy to maintain integrity, it also must deploy energetically expensive molecular processes required to shift its identity toward its terminal state, adding to the energetic cost of life.\nBut, living systems possess a finite capacity to transform energy [40]. The interplay of limited energetic capacity with the competing demands of molecular processes leads to energy constraints both within cells [41] and organisms [42]. The limited energy budget means that not all cellular or physiological systems can be turned on at the same time. Moreover, some transformations are also not compatible and must be separated in time (e.g., catabolic and anabolic pathways). Therefore, by necessity and to preserve efficiency in a given physiological context, one state must be dominant over other ones.\nConsequently, an evolutionarily-driven hierarchy of energy needs dictates which molecular system is prioritized over another one. For example, cells must prioritize the maintenance of vital membrane potential through ion pumps, and of protein synthesis by ribosomes, over the more acutely dispensable DNA and RNA synthesis by polymerases [43]. Similarly, at the scale of the mammalian body, blood flow to the so-called \"vital\" organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and kidneys is prioritized over digestive and connective tissues, particularly in times of (real or perceived) stress.

    "text": "Aerobic mammalian cells derive most of their usable energy from the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system within mitochondria. The OxPhos system pulls and reacts hydrocarbon-derived electrons with oxygen to build a transmembrane charge that powers ATP synthesis. For this reason, mitochondria naturally play a permissive role in sustaining life and enabling all psychobiological life transitions [44].\nBy producing ATP on demand—that is, when ATP is hydrolyzed into ADP and inorganic phosphate—mitochondria essentially \"keep the lights on\", enabling life's vital operations. But an important question is whether beyond its permissive role, energy transformation by mitochondrial OxPhos also plays an instructive role in shaping major cellular transitions, including differentiation from a stem-like precursor cell type to a terminally differentiated state.\nIt is well recognized that by controlling apoptosis, mitochondria dictate the ultimate death transition [45, 46]. We also know that terminal cell differentiation across cell lineages and contexts acutely depends on [47–49] and is even temporally controlled [50, 51] by mitochondrial redox and metabolite signaling, fusion-fission dynamics, and energetics [52–56]. Thus, mitochondria unequivocally play an instructive role in contributing to fuel and regulate stressful cellular identity transitions.\nHowever, one major outstanding question has persisted around the molecular mechanisms through which mitochondrial OxPhos defects are transduced to the nucleus, via so-called \"retrograde signaling\". We recently reported that primary human fibroblasts with OxPhos defects—which exhibit nuclear stress responses—expend up to twice as much energy to stay alive under resting conditions [57]. OxPhos defects increase the cost of living, or energy expenditure, likely through multiple cellular, tissue-level, and physiological stress response mechanisms that promote hypermetabolism [58]. Similarly, glucocorticoid signaling alone (which is not intrinsically damaging) in primary fibroblasts also induces an \"anticipatory\" stress response that increases cellular energy expenditure by ~60% [59]. Based on the economy of cellular energy outlined above, the cost of stress responses may expectedly conflict with the energetic requirements of differentiation, as observed in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells where OxPhos defects interfered with cellular differentiation [60].\nHow are the competing energetic demands of responding to intrinsically stressful OxPhos defects reconciled with the energetic requirements of cell fate transition? Might energetic stress responses and cell fate transitions be incompatible? If they are incompatible, might this explain developmental failure and pathogenesis in animal models of OxPhos defects and patients with mitochondrial diseases?",

Upon stress signaling, phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) signals through CHOP [CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homology protein] (Ddit3) [63] and activating transcription factors Atf4 and Atf5 to upregulate the expression of several downstream genes [61, 64] (Fig. 2b). Other stress signal transduction cascades may also converge on the ISR [65]. The epistatic network of relationships among ISR genes is still being uncovered in different species and cell types.\nOne of the best-described ISR targets, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), is transcribed and secreted into the extracellular space, making its way into the bloodstream to exert broad systemic signaling effects [66]. GDF15 concentration is elevated in the blood of patients with OxPhos defects [67, 68], in the media of cultured cells with genetic or pharmacological OxPhos defects [57], as well as under other metabolically challenging situations including pregnancy [69] and starvation [70]—making GDF15 a putative general marker of \"energetic stress\". Another ISR target, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), is also systemically upregulated in human and animal mitochondrial OxPhos defects, where it contributes to systemic ISR signaling [71]. The ISR-GDF15 axis appears to act as a metabolic stress signaling network, which among other roles may exist to inform the brain of energetic/redox stress among somatic tissues [66].

However, different OxPhos defects can trigger the ISR through different mechanisms [73, 74]. In addition, non-OxPhos mitochondrial stressors can also induce the ISR, including misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix [75, 76] and iron deficiency via the mitochondrial death ligand signal enhancer 1 (DELE1) [77], indicating that several triggers and molecular pathways act upstream of the mitochondrial ISR.",

Most of these genes were induced at levels above the expression levels naturally induced in healthy transitional lung epithelial cells, suggesting that the OxPhos defects tapped into the same pathway. However, in this case, the OxPhos defects amplified this pathway to a point where the ISR became maladaptive or pathological.\nBoth genetic and pharmacological OxPhos defects reliably activate Gdf15 expression in mammalian cells, including in primary human fibroblasts [57]. Interestingly, pathological ISR activation in the developing lung was not driven by ATP deficiency. Rather, it was triggered by reductive stress, reflected by an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio, which is a natural consequence of mitochondrial complex I deficiency.\nWith normal OxPhos function, NADH donates its electron to complex I, oxidizing it back to NAD+. It was previously shown in myoblasts that oxidizing cytosolic NADH to NAD+ is sufficient to prevent ISR activation in complex I-deficient cells [73]. Recent work also confirmed that selectively inducing NADH reductive stress, without OxPhos deficiency, is sufficient to activate the ISR [78]. Han et al. extended these findings to the in vivo developing lung as they demonstrated that alleviating reductive stress by enzymatically oxidizing NADH prevented pathological alveolar ISR activation, thereby normalizing lung development [6]. Complex I-deficient mice protected from cytoplasmic reductive stress by overexpression of the yeast NADH dehydrogenase Ndi1 developed normally for up to 25 months.\nIn the context of monitoring costly cellular transitions, the NADH/NAD+ ratio is naturally a major driving force. The cellular energy landscape required to sustain stressful and costly transitions involves not only the phosphorylation potential (ATP/ADP/AMP) that powers several enzymatic reactions but also the redox potential (NADH/NAD+) that powers and regulates perhaps an equal, if not larger, number of molecular transitions [79]. The central dependence of so many reactions on NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ ratio may account for why it has evolved perhaps preferentially in some cell types as a sufficient and perhaps most potent trigger of the ISR.",

Upregulated under pathological conditions, the ISR places affected cells into a pro-survival state, likely as an attempt to re-establish cellular homeostasis [61]. Non-essential and costly cellular processes are put on hold (e.g., initial ISR-dependent inhibition of translation), while pro-survival essential processes are upregulated.\nDirect support for the view that the ISR is \"pathological\" comes from the demonstration that inhibiting the ISR in the presence of the OxPhos complex I defects increases survival. In lung epithelial cells, ISR activation contributes to pathophysiology and mortality [6]. By serving as an inflexible cellular checkpoint, ISR activation in OxPhos-deficient developing alveolar epithelial cells appears to prevent the transition of AT2 cells into AT1 cells, without which the lung is not functional, and animals are not viable (Fig. 2c, left). Similarly, in mice with OxPhos-deficient skeletal muscles caused by mtDNA deletion, deleting FGF21 rescues some aspects of the pathological phenotype, suggesting that secreted ISR products contribute to pathophysiology in mice [71].",

    "text": "A second related developmental proposition is that robust ISR activation evolved to prevent energetically compromised cells from engaging in excessively costly cell fate transitions. Initiating an energetically challenging transition without the assurance that sufficient resources are present could result in cell death, compromising animal survival. This is supported by the complete inhibition of AT2-to-AT1 transition in ISR-induced Ndufs2 knockout cells [6]. Normal developmental or regenerative transitions induce the ISR, but at lower levels that do not inhibit AT2-to-AT1 transitions (Fig. 2c, middle). In this case, the ISR may be triggered to prevent costly cellular commitment that could be fatal, and therefore detrimental to the organism.\nThis dual role of ISR upregulation in cellular differentiation was also demonstrated in a model of a rare genetic skeletal disorder, in which endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress upregulated the ISR in hypertrophic chondrocytes [81]. Also, in this model, ISR-positive cells survived but transitioned back into a \"juvenile\" state. Importantly, Atf4 was also expressed during normal (embryonic) development in differentiating chondrocytes. Inhibiting the ISR rescued skeletal abnormalities but had no impact on normal development of healthy (wild-type) mice [81]. These findings suggest that the ISR may be normally upregulated by default during development, possibly as a way of heightening the cell's sensitivity to potential energetic stress. Supporting this view, other studies suggest that the ISR is activated preceding energetically demanding cellular expansion in activated T lymphocytes [82]. Iron deficiency can also trigger the ISR [83]. Whether stressors other than OxPhos also trigger the ISR to inhibit cell fate transitions remains unclear. More work is needed to understand the role of ISR activation during normal cellular differentiation and embryonic development.",

    "text": "Let us remember that all mammalian nuclear programs and signaling pathways, including the ISR, must have evolved to optimize the fitness of the organism. The organism, not single cells, is the ultimate unit of natural selection. Therefore, we likely will approach the most accurate physiological interpretation of the ISR if we manage to understand its effects beyond the confine of the cell, in the context of the organism.\nThe third potential interpretation is that the ISR is a cellular-level sensor evolved to inform the organism of somatic energetic stress. In animals, ISR-mediated GDF15 secretion from affected tissues, including skeletal muscles [84] and adipocytes [85] appears to contribute to accelerating physiological processes, increasing whole-body energy expenditure [86]. OxPhos-deficient cells produce GDF15 that elevates the rate of energy transformation across the whole organism and likely plays other roles related to energy balance [62]. Intuitively, cells with energy production defects would be expected to adopt or deploy energy conservation strategies. However, as noted above, mitochondrial OxPhos defects increase energy expenditure to produce a state of cellular hypermetabolism [57]. In fact, OxPhos defects cause hyperactive physiology at multiple levels: OxPhos-deficient individuals secrete more catecholamines, have higher resting heart rate, grow more capillaries around OxPhos-deficient myofibers, and produce exaggerated cardiovascular and ventilatory responses to mild physical challenges [58, 87, 88]. Collectively, we can understand these hyperkinetic responses as mechanisms that cooperate to increase energy delivery to OxPhos-deficient, ISR-positive cells, which behave and signal as if energy starved.\nBased on these facts, we reason that the physiological purpose of these ISR-driven hyperactive systems is to ensure the availability of energy resources (oxygen, carbon substrates) to all cells within the organism. The brain plays a major role in ensuring that cells and organs cooperate toward the same goal—the survival of the organism. Thus, the brain naturally harbors the cognate GDF15 receptor GFRAL (GDNF family receptor α-like) [89], allowing it to sense circulating GDF15, a major endocrine output of the ISR [66]. In mice, GDF15 also appears to recruit the glucose-releasing and hyperglycemia-promoting hormone corticosterone, further mobilizing energetic resources to fuel energy-starved ISR-positive and GDF15-secreting cells and tissues [90]. Thus, cells may use the ISR gene program and its secreted products to call in additional energetic resources from surrounding cells and organs to support them through challenging transitional times (Fig. 2c, right). But in OxPhos-deficient cells, the ISR appears permanently activated, the chronicity of which likely contributes to the pathological effects of the ISR.\nThe true function of the ISR is likely a dynamic combination of these propositions, expressed differently depending on the developmental context, cell type, stress exposure, and metabolic state of the organism.",

    "text": "Life transitions are inherently \"stressful\" because they cost energy. OxPhos defects appear to increase the cost of life in cells, animals, and people [57, 58]. This likely occurs because cells that contain OxPhos-deficient mitochondria must bend their metabolism and behaviors out of shape, forced to induce and utilize less optimal metabolic strategies to survive. But in turn, the costly compensations that actively push them away from their optimal bioenergetic state require activating compensatory stress response pathways. These include but are not limited to the ISR. The ISR itself triggers costly genetic programs leading to metabokine protein synthesis, secretion, cell-cell signaling, and even somato-cognitive (i.e., body-brain) signaling that conveys systemic energetic distress to the brain [66].\nRecent research shows that in the context of mitochondrial complex I-related OxPhos defects, the ISR can interfere with and prevent stressful cell fate transitions in mouse lung epithelial cells, resulting in death [6]. Building on previous [73] and recent work [78], the new findings cement the notion that reductive stress (elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio) is a necessary and sufficient ISR trigger in this in vivo context. Importantly, we also learn that normal developmental cell fate transitions involve ISR activation, suggesting that the ISR is a physiologically meaningful rheostat of stress signaling induced as part of normal, albeit challenging, cellular life transitions.\nEach cell must operate as an information processing system monitoring its capacity to engage in costly life transitions. The new single-cell molecular details around ISR biology [6], interpreted through the lens of an economy of energy [39, 42, 91], suggests that the ISR is a central circuit of the cellular and mitochondrial information processing system [92] that weighs bioenergetic demand and supply.\nBut several questions arise. Does the ISR play the same \"checkpoint\" role in all cell types, across species? At the scale of an individual, do stressful and energetically costly lifespan psychobiological transitions also trigger the ISR or other energy monitoring pathways to steer the organism toward the most optimal path to adaptation? Can our understanding of ISR biology be harnessed to assist cells and individuals in reaching their full developmental and health potential?\nMitochondrial stress signaling is a burgeoning field replete with inspiring questions heavy with health implications. Addressing these questions across scales of complexity—from organelle to organism—requires that we integrate molecular energy sensing mechanisms within the brain-body and psychobiological systems that shape development and aging trajectories. Increasingly precise technologies and versatile approaches to probe stress responses across time and space make this a particularly exciting time for biology. Our ability to leverage new technologies informed by bioenergetic principles promises to produce increasingly more accurate models of health and development.",

    "text": "Aging presents as a severe, progressive reduction in functional capacity and quality of life with a 100% penetrance.1,2 It also presents fascinating fundamental questions in evolutionary, cell, and developmental biology with respect to the algorithms implemented by living tissues to maintain form and function against disorder.3–12 Numerous theories of the underlying molecular causes of aging have been proposed.13-21 One set of approaches focuses on the progressive degradation of developmental information-cues that allow tissues to maintain a complex morphology for decades while materials and individual cells move in and out of the body. Since one key aspect of this information structure is maintained in bioelectrical gradients of resting potential across tissues, it has been suggested that degradation22-24 of specifically bioelectric information could be a cause of aging.25,26\n\nPatterns of cellular resting potential (Vmem) have been measured in a variety of embryonic, regenerative, and oncogenic contexts,27–31 due to the known role of developmental bioelectricity in regulating morphogenesis and cancer suppression.22,23 However, no data are currently available on large-scale bioelectric profiles during aging in vivo in any model species. This is a rate-limiting step in the development of electroceuticals for longevity. Moreover, additional bioelectricity-relevant approaches involve applying specific electromagnetic fields and pulsed electromagnetic fields to slow down aging,32-34 performing transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation to improve the declining cognitive functions,35,36 regulating the body's ion channels with morphoceuticals25,37 or gero-electroceuticals,38 bioelectrically controlling stem cells such as their ability to differentiate or continue regenerating,39 and regulating the restoration of the body's aging bioelectrics with implantable and wearable bioelectronic devices.40 Evaluating, improving, and extending these pioneering approaches require a better understanding of the bioelectric pattern of young versus old individuals. Thus, we sought to establish a dataset on whole-body bioelectric imaging in a model system that is relevant for aging research.41–43\n\nHydra are relatively small freshwater invertebrates. They have endodermal and ectodermal tissues and can reproduce both sexually and asexually.44 They have been used as a model organism in many studies45 focusing on morphogenesis,46,47 environmental ecotoxicology,48,49 bacteriology,50 regeneration,1,41,51,52 biomechanics,53 evolution of multicellularity,54 morphogenesis and physiology,55,56 transplantation biology,45 tumor biology,57-59 whole-body neural and muscle activity via calcium imaging,60–63 apoptosis,43,64 and aging.42,65-71 Their body is transparent, enabling membrane voltage (Vmem)-sensitive dyes66-68 to easily penetrate and reveal cellular membrane voltage of the whole organism. At 22°C, cold-sensitive (CS) Hydra oligactis are immortal. However, at 10°C, CS H. oligactis begin to switch to sexual reproduction and produce ovaries and testes within 3–4 weeks.69,70 Within 30 days at 10°, CS H. oligactis undergo aging and eventually die by day 150.71 It is known that 80% of the human aging genes from the Human Ageing Genomic Resources (http://genomics.senescence.info) are conserved in hydra.42 Aging CS H. oligactis are less able to grab prey, perform spontaneous contractions, transfer food to their gut, and have fewer sperm and nurse cells after 2 months, fewer numbers of interstitial stem cells, and fewer epithelial cells.71 This makes CS H. oligactis an ideal model system in which to begin to test hypotheses about the role of bioelectrics in the aging process. However, the bioelectrics of whole-body immortal and aging hydra are unknown.\n\nWe established an imaging protocol for this species and tested the hypothesis that bioelectric patterns (nonhomogeneous spatial distributions of Vmem) would exist and would change with aging, especially becoming less crisp and more diffuse (degradation of prepattern as observed during some birth defects72). Moreover, we tested whether aging CS H. oligactis would be more or less hyperpolarized than immortal CS H. oligactis.",

Second, they reach the correct target morphology reliably, utilizing heredity mechanisms to propagate specific patterns of form and behavior through time. Crucially, third, this process is almost never hard-wired, but instead offers immense plasticity, able to complete morphogenetic tasks despite perturbations of external environment and internal components [1]. This capacity to navigate the morphospace of possible anatomies, to produce the correct final pattern in the face of novel situations, or to create something completely different (never before seen by evolution) but nevertheless coherent and adaptively functional [2], is an example of problem-solving ability in a high-dimensional latent space. This lynchpin capacity ties together fields of evolutionary developmental biology, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, computational and information science, and the emerging field of diverse intelligence. The implications of understanding the multiscale behavior of the active matter of life during embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer suppression range across biomedicine, bioengineering, robotics, and bio-inspired artificial intelligence (AI). Central to this set of questions is the relationship between the genetically specified hardware inside cells and the resulting physiological software that produces phenotypes acted upon by selection.

The genome does not encode organismal traits or developmental processes directly (it encodes the protein-level hardware necessary for cell behavior and information processing). The new ideas being developed try to go beyond 'blueprint' or 'program' metaphors and instead identify the genome as compressed latent variables – analogous to Waddington's gene landscape and biologically implemented via protein-encoding sequences and gene regulatory factors – that instantiate organismal development literally as a generative model [3]. It is hypothesized that the genome comprises compressed latent variables that are shaped or encoded by evolution and natural selection, and decoded by a generative model implemented by the cells of the developing embryo that is strikingly similar to the way information is processed in biological and engineered cognitive systems [3,6]. Development can thus be interpreted as a hierarchical generative decoding process from a single cell into a mature organism that is similar but not identical to its ancestors, a reconstruction with variational adaptations and mutations, but also dynamic and flexible interpretation of past information as suitable for new contexts [6]. As we argue later, this kind of architecture enables not only fidelity (reliability) in reaching the correct species-specific target morphology, but also creative problem-solving that maximizes adaptive saliency to new scenarios, not just hardwired replication of what was successful with prior environments and genetics.

Typically, the decoding-stack of VAEs occurs hierarchically, going from abstract representations through adding modular features to detailed reconstructions of the original data, closely resembling, in turn, the developmental stack of embryogenesis. The latent space can capture emergent properties of the data, such as clusters or manifolds that represent different classes or features (modularity). Generative models, including VAEs, generate data by sampling from this latent space, variational latent variables allowing for the creation of novel examples conforming but not identical to the training data (adaptation).

The assertion that DNA instantiates a generative model of the organism [3] has been actively debated [4-6,16-19]. However, authors differ as to whether their proposed generative model covers: (i) the entire developmental stack from the genome to the organism, or targets (ii) a single decoding layer between the genome and a cellular phenotype. This raises questions about how such a model might be applied across different scales of biological organization (cf. Figure 1B):\n\n(i) Biology is organized in layers within layers of abstraction, where the components of each organizational level efficiently navigate their respective problem domains [5,16,17], including metabolic, transcriptomic, physiological, anatomical, and behavioral state spaces. More than that: biological agents, even those comprising the same organism continuously influence (i.e., 'hack') each other either in symbiotic or adversarial relations, including among the organs of a single organism [20-22].\n\n(ii) Even individual cells dynamically respond to environmental cues but can also reconfigure internally via gene regulatory networks (GRNs), displaying significant structural and operational plasticity, including several different kinds of learning [4,5,18,23].\n\nVAEs are single-shot generators with limited generative variability stemming from noise applied at the latent space level. The subsequent decoder is a deterministic downstream process with no room for further variability or creativity. By contrast, organismal development is inherently distributed with a collective of agents constantly reinterpreting and reacting to signals and noise across scales [5,18]. Following the VAE metaphor, this is fundamentally different from variations only in the latent space, and would rather affect every node within the decoder, massively departing from the typical deterministic downstream decoding processes. Moreover, embryonic viability requires adherence to stringent physiological and energetic criteria throughout development, while vanilla VAEs do not enforce physical constraints on intermediate states during decoding.",

    "text": "One exciting aspect of using deep concepts from ML to shed light on biology is that it provides a rigorous formalism for unifying dynamics of cognitive and morphological change. The idea that the self-assembly of the body had important symmetries with the construction of minds must have already been apparent to Turing, who famously was not only interested in unconventional embodiments of intelligence and patterns of mental activity [24] but also in the self-assembly of structural patterns during development [25]. Another notable contribution to this field was Grossberg's prescient 'Communication, memory, and development' [26]. However, advances in connectionist approaches to problem-solving in synthetic media have provided more specific architectural principles around which somatic and cognitive competency can be organized. [27-32]\n\nStarting in 2016, Pezzulo and Levin [4] discussed how top-down approaches, such as the free energy principle (FEP) [33-36], can model developmental processes through nested bowtie architectures (i.e., where diverse molecular mechanisms converge on critical intermediates to achieve high-level goals through distributed self-orchestration). This concept highlights the efficiency and robustness of the generative developmental and evolutionary process of biological systems. Subsequent works [16,17] further explore scale-free and hierarchical dynamics in development, emphasizing the FEP's unifying role in evolution and development and introducing the concept of biology as a multiscale competency architecture (MCA), with causal top-down and bottom-up control pathways. They specifically proposed that tissue, organs, organ systems, and other levels of biological organization arise as the generalization of compressed information at molecular levels, as occurs in multilayer ANNs, and framed regeneration as a kind of pattern completion task [37] (see Box 1 for explanations of computer science terms).\n\nThis led to the idea that each individual within an MCA is an autonomous agent, actively navigating their respective environments and problem spaces [17]. In turn, a unified approach to understanding biological self-organization is arguably rooted in localized homeostatic agents following cooperatively coordinated error correction principles (Figure 1C).\n\nAlthough somatic cells have been domesticated by multicellularity, and their behavior is regulated by many exogenous factors in vivo to align them toward large-scale setpoints at the organ and tissue level, they navigate physiological, transcriptional, metabolic, and anatomical problem spaces under the influence of their own priors as well as of cues from the local and remote internal environment [18]. Thus, a critical missing piece in our understanding of development and evolution is the fact evolution operates on an agential material, not passive, or even merely active, matter: cells can integrate multiple modalities of sensory data and make context-sensitive decisions [38-41], and even the molecular networks inside of cells can implement several different kinds of learning, including Pavlovian conditioning [23,42,43].",

By contrast and complement, our framework [4-6,16-19] emphasizes the fundamental role of goal-directed problem-solving and collective intelligence of biological systems across scales in developmental and evolutionary pathways.\n\nThe paradox of change is a profound invariant across spatio-temporal scales, materials, and problem spaces, equally affecting embryos, behaving individuals, and evolutionary lineages. If a system stays the same, it will not survive when circumstances call for novel form or function. But if it changes and adapts, it is no longer the same system and the original has likewise, to an extent, disappeared. Thus, the question of what it is that persists through evolutionary change, morphogenesis/metamorphosis, and learning can be better visualized as a process of contextual sense-making, not an object. We have visualized it as a bowtie dynamic, which is traversed by active agents continuously (Figure 1).\n\nIn the case of learning, the center of the bowtie is the 'now' moment. The left side of the bowtie is the deductive, algorithmic process of learning and generalization, which their cognitive system compressed from individual instances of experience. But beings never have access to the actual past - what they have access to is the engrams stored in their brain (and possibly body [51]). Thus, the right side of the bowtie is a creative process in which the cognitive system must reconstruct the meaning of these engrams, but optimizing for saliency in the current situation, not constancy of the meaning these biophysical messages had for their past self.\n\nThe same dynamic occurs in embryonic development and evolution. Counter to the familiar model in which the genetics reproduces a map of a fixed body structure, morphogenesis is a creative, problem-solving process which utilizes information in the genome but is not a hardwired, mechanical result of it. The experience of past members of a lineage is stored in a generative seed - the genome, which does not directly code for phenotypic features. The process of producing a functional body given the prompt of the genome is as much a sense-making effort, executed by the biomechanical, biochemical, and bioelectrical networks of protoplasm to navigate physiological and anatomical spaces as is the memory-interpretation task of neural networks in brains as an animal navigates the 3D space of behavior. We propose that what evolution builds are not fixed solutions to fixed environments, but problem-solving agents, exerting well-demonstrated competencies to use genetically provided affordances in new ways as needed (discussed in detail in [5,6]).",

Viewing biology as operating over an active, computational, decision-making material (as opposed to fixed mappings between genetic information and phenotypic outcomes) has many implications for how we relate to it in biomedical settings (recent emphasis being on prompts and behavior-shaping communication [52]), but also for evolution. Recent computational modeling efforts showed that the competency of the material hides information from selection, leading much of the work to be done on the competency mechanisms themselves [48,49]. This results in augmented ability of the material to creatively adapt to changes in its genetics, thus accelerating the evolutionary process, and kickstarting a positive feedback loop which scales primitive competencies of living matter into the more obvious intelligence of brainy animals.\n\nIt is essential to develop a rigorous understanding of the substrate- and scale-invariant learning and creative problem-solving dynamics that tie together morphogenesis, evolution, and learning [28,29,53,54].\n\nWhile the VAE architecture in particular might not yet capture such recurrent multiscale dynamics, fundamental questions remain about the differences and similarities between active inference systems, collective goal-directed agents, and (self-regulatory) generative models, especially in distributed and hierarchical systems. One might interpret every biological agent as a generative model - with an informational bowtie at its core - sampling or generating actions from a policy subordinate to a higher-level goal state. Consequently, organismal development would be characterized as a highly noisy, recurrent, and hierarchically multiplexed generative process.",

This is consistent with the common intuition that other people are “minded” (i.e., they have a theory of mind; Premack & Woodruff, 1978), which is often extended to non-human animals without significant controversy. As S&C suggest, the same willingness to attribute sentience to animals by analogy must be afforded to plants. That animal sentience is inferred on the basis of some likeness to humans is ultimately an intuition. To be consistent, in the absence of uniquely tuned properties afforded to a narrow kind of cellular substrate, the same charitable interpretation must be extended to all systems that display observable response patterns that are consistent with animal cognition, including artificial intelligences, metaplastic materials (Loeffler et al., 2023), and robotic systems (Clawson and Levin, 2022).

Individual intelligence is uncontroversial. It occurs in organisms with special neural machinery, evolved by natural selection to enable cognitive and learning functions that serve the fitness benefit of the organism, and then trained through lifetime experience to maximise individual rewards. Whilst the mechanisms of individual intelligence are not fully understood, good models exist for many aspects of individual cognition and learning. Collective intelligence, in contrast, is a much more ambiguous idea. What exactly constitutes collective intelligence is often vague, and the mechanisms that might enable it are frequently domain-specific. These cannot be mechanisms selected specifically for the purpose of collective intelligence because collectives are not (except in special circumstances) evolutionary units, and it is not clear that collectives can learn the way individual intelligences do since they are not a singular locus of rewards and benefits. Here, we use examples from evolution and developmental morphogenesis to argue that these apparent distinctions are not as categorical as they appear. Breaking down such distinctions enables us to borrow from and expand existing models of individual cognition and learning as a framework for collective intelligence, in particular connectionist models familiar in the context of neural networks. We discuss how specific features of these models inform the necessary and sufficient conditions for collective intelligence, and identify current knowledge gaps as opportunities for future research.\n\nKeywords\nEvolution, machine learning, networks, individuality, neural networks",

    "text": "Individual and collective intelligence are distinct phenomena. Or are they?\nAt first glance, it might seem that models of individual intelligence are not relevant to collective intelligence. Individuals have brains that can cognise and learn, and although colonies and swarms might be composed of individuals with brains, the collective as a whole is not a brain and cannot cognise or learn. Moreover, it is easy to understand why the component parts of an individual work together so well because adaptive processes at the organismic level, such as evolution by natural selection and reward-based reinforcement, select or reward them for doing so. In contrast, collectives are composed of multiple evolutionary units or distributed multi-agent systems and thus present unique credit-assignment problems that complicate reinforcement of such adaptive processes. Such distinctions seem to justify the consideration of collective and organismic intelligences as different topics. We argue that these are false distinctions and there is a bigger, and much more interesting, picture. The basic tenets of this unified view are the following:\n\nAll individuals are collectives. All individuals are collectives, made of parts that used to be individuals themselves. This is true not only for multicellular organisms derived from unicellular ancestors but also for eukaryotic cells with multiple organelles arising from bacterial ancestors, and for simpler cells that contain the first chromosomes arising from the union of previously free-living self-replicating molecules (Godfrey-Smith, 2009; Maynard Smith and Szathmáry, 1997; Michod, 2000; Okasha, 2006; West et al., 2015). Moreover, the proper functioning of organisms – their robustness, adaptability and evolvability – depends on the continued autonomy of their component parts (Levin, 2019; 2021a). Multicellular organisms exhibit multi-scale autonomy, a dynamic interplay of competition and cooperation, and coordinated collective action inherent to their development, function and behaviour, while being a society of cells (Fields and Levin, 2022; Levin, 2019; 2022; 2023; Sonnenschein and Soto, 1999). Thus, individuals like you and I, and collectives like swarms and colonies, are not as categorically different as they first appear.\n\nAll intelligences are collectives. Individual intelligence, in the familiar guise of a central nervous system or a brain, arises from the interaction of many unintelligent components (neurons) arranged in the right organisation with the right connections. This is the foundation of connectionism; that intelligence resides not in the individual parts but in the arrangement of the connections between them (LeCun et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2016; Watson and Szathmáry, 2016). The individual neuron is not where all the interesting cognition and learning occur. It is the distributed collective activity in the network that constitutes cognition and changes to the organisation of network connections that constitute learning. So brains are collectives, thus collectives of the right kind do cognise and learn. In fact, brains provide the archetypal example of an intelligent collective.\n\nCognition and learning are substrate-independent. The principles of distributed cognition familiar in artificial neural networks can be implemented by any network of signals and non-linear responses to suitably weighted inputs (Evans et al., 2022; Stern and Murugan, 2022; Watson et al., 2016). Gene-regulation networks, ecological networks and social networks can all compute in the same sense as neural networks if the connections are suitably arranged (Biswas et al., 2021; Davies et al., 2011; Herrera-Delgado et al., 2018; Power et al., 2015; Szabó et al., 2012; Tareen and Kinney, 2020; Watson et al., 2014). In development and organismic biology, many different levels of adaptive networks exist aside from neural networks, including gene-regulation networks, protein networks, metabolic networks, morphogen diffusion networks and endocrine systems. In addition, it is clear that morphogenesis, physiological function and the adaptive processes of robustness and repair all require information integration and collective action that constitute cognition – in many cases without neurons. Each of these phenomena exhibits the same learning behaviours, including the storage and retrieval of multiple associative memories, effecting classification and recognition with generalisation capabilities, and learning to solve combinatorial optimisation problems better with experience (Watson et al., 2011a; Watson et al., 2011b, 2011c).\n\nThe credit assignment problems inherent in collective intelligence are fundamental in all cognition and learning, and in all biological individuality. It is true that collective intelligence is fundamentally about collectives - meaning that we cannot presuppose the system as a whole to be a single selective or utility-maximising unit. However, when we take a larger perspective – for example, one concerned with their emergence over developmental or evolutionary timescales – neither can we presuppose that apparently unambiguous individuals have always been (single) selective or utility-maximising units. Thus, the credit assignment issues of collective intelligence are not categorically distinct from related core issues in individual adaptation, evolution and intelligence.",

    "text": "Towards a unified theory of intelligence and cognition\nIn collectives, each component selects behaviours based on the rewards they receive for their own actions (Figure 1(a)). In intelligent systems, the reward feedback is effectively operating at a higher level – and the system as a whole selects behaviours based on the rewards received by the system as a whole (Figure 1(b)). Accordingly, it makes sense that the system selects behaviours that facilitate long-term collective reward. But operationally, each component within the intelligent system is still autonomous, selecting individual actions based on individual rewards given the relational context they find themselves in. The question is, what kinds of interaction structures cause collectives to behave like intelligent agents, exhibiting information integration and coordinated action that effect reward feedback at the system level? (Figure 1(c)). Here, we propose a formalism for thinking about these issues as a set of hypotheses to drive future research.\n\nEstablishing these commonalities has significant consequences for understanding: since some of these questions have well-developed answers in the context of individual intelligences, those answers can be transferred to provide a framework for approaching collective intelligences. While connectionist models of cognition and learning do not have all the answers, they do identify the kind of relationships that turn a collection of unintelligent components into a collective intelligence, with cognitive and learning abilities that belong to the whole and not the parts. Additionally, connectionist models identify conditions where collective intelligence can arise bottom-up, using only distributed learning mechanisms without system-level or global feedback.\n\nWe do not attempt a comprehensive review of the many related topics involved. Rather, we have selected foundational points to clarify a vision of distributed cognition, bottom-up adaptation and, more generally, the ‘more than the sum of the parts' conceptual territory.",

What makes collectives individuals (as opposed to merely populations in containers) is their intelligence – their degree of competency in solving novel problems (Fields and Levin, 2022; Levin, 2023). The processes of development are the substrate of this intelligence – the ‘glue’ that makes the whole more than the sum of the parts (Levin, 2019). A large body of work indicates that development is not well-characterised as the execution of a pre-programmed genetic script but rather as an active, dynamic and adaptive process. Although all cells in most multicellular organisms share the same genome, the remarkable protein machinery that genome encodes, along with the cytoskeletal and lipid structures each cell inherits from its ancestors (Fields and Levin, 2018b), enables a collective of embryonic cells to develop differentiated roles and self-organise into a large-scale, functional machine. Development thus involves a multi-scale hierarchy of cooperating and competing subunits (Fields and Levin, 2020), each with local computational and goal-directed capacity, that enables the whole to function as a singular subject of memories and preferences – a unified locus of learning and homeostatic loops that harness its subunits towards goal states.",

Anatomical homeostasis – the ability to adjust anatomy despite injury or drastic rearrangement (Harris, 2018; Levin et al., 2019) – requires the collective to have a degree of autonomous problem-solving activity in morphospace, defined as the space of possible anatomical configurations (Stone, 1997). For example, eyes developed ectopically in the tails of frog embryos still allow the animals to see (Blackiston and Levin, 2013) because the eye primordia cells succeed not only in forming an eye and optic nerve in an abnormal environment but also in connecting the optic nerve to the nervous system (in this case, via synapse onto the spinal cord, rather than the brain). Another example is the development of the newt kidney tubule (Fankhauser, 1945a; 1945b): normally cell-cell communication among ~8 cells produces the correct tubule diameter, but if the cells are made very large, they still produce the same diameter tubule by using fewer cells. Even when cell size gets very large, a single cell can achieve the same diameter tubule by bending around itself (this time using cytoskeletal mechanisms). Thus, genetically wild-type cells can harness distinct molecular components, depending on the novel circumstances, to reach the same high-level anatomical goal. This disrupts a straightforward reductionist or bottom-up account of organismal morphology and function. Whilst natural selection provides the genetic hardware, this hardware has a very particular kind of plasticity, which implements robustness to both external and internal novelty. This derives from an architecture of multi-scale competency (Fields and Levin, 2020; Gawne et al., 2020), where many subsystems are themselves goal-directed and can pursue specific endpoints despite changes in their tissue environment, greatly potentiating evolvability. The idea of organisms as pre-specified machines, assembled by genetic scripts, fails in the context of these and other examples of developmental robustness.

    "text": "Basal cognition in development: Morphological problem-solving. ‘Basal cognition’ refers to information processing that occurs in an unconventional substrate and/or as a simpler evolutionary precursor to what we conventionally consider cognition (Baluška and Levin, 2016; Levin, 2019; Manicka and Levin, 2019a). This is not cognition that depends on neurons or necessarily involves second-order self-awareness (Levin, 2019). It refers to cognition in an algorithmic sense that is substrate-independent (Levin, 2019) and is observable as problem-solving across phylogenetic history (Keijzer et al., 2013; Levin et al., 2021; Lyon, 2015; Lyon et al., 2021). What is important in basal cognition is not the presence of neurons but the presence of functional and informational interactions that facilitate both information integration and the ability to orchestrate cued responses that coordinate action (Bechtel and Bich, 2021; Grossberg, 1978; Levin, 2019). This can be implemented by suitable interactions of any nature including gene regulatory networks, cell signalling, bio-electric networks and morphogenetic chemical feedbacks (Lyon et al., 2021).\n\nFor example, the process of growing a limb constitutes basal cognition, as it requires both integration of multi-dimensional information (e.g. to ‘decide’ appendage type or handedness, from context) and collective action to put this ‘basal decision’ (Bechtel and Bich, 2021) into action (e.g. to coordinate the timing, abundance and positioning of cellular differentiation and growth (Dinet et al., 2021; Fields and Levin, 2020; Moczek, 2019). More broadly, regulative development, regeneration and remodelling (such as morphogenesis) require collective decision making and memory at two scales: on the part of cells (collectives of molecular networks) and of tissues (collectives of cells). Limb re-generation, for example, requires a memory of the correct pattern, the ability to compare current state with the target state and the ability to traverse anatomical morphospace in different ways depending on context and perturbations (Pezzulo and Levin, 2016).\n\nWilliam James’ definition of intelligence – the ability to achieve the same goal in multiple ways (James, 1890) – provides context for considering the basal intelligence of cell collectives in morphogenesis. It has become clear that the large-scale morphological goals of an organism override and harness the local competencies of individual cells to adaptively navigate morphospace (Levin, 2022a). That navigation capacity is not hardwired but shows considerable problem-solving plasticity (reviewed in (Levin, 2023)). Numerous examples indicate that morphogenesis meets James’s definition of intelligence by achieving normal anatomy despite a wide range of serious perturbations. For example, developing Xenopus tadpoles can attain the same anatomical outcome despite starting with their craniofacial organs scrambled (Vandenberg et al., 2012) or with the wrong number of cells (Cooke, 1979, 1981). Even mammalian embryos can overcome drastic perturbations such as amputation; and early embryo splitting in humans results in normal monozygotic twins rather than partial bodies.\n\nThe ability of collectives of cells to pursue, with various degrees of competency, target states in anatomical morphospace (Levin, 2023; Stone, 1997) reveals an important aspect of being an individual: solving problems in a space different from that occupied by its parts (Fields and Levin, 2022; Levin, 2023). While individual cells cannot ascertain the right number, size or position of eyes or fingers, tissues do so routinely, that is, the tissue as a collective executes morphogenesis through differential cell reproduction and differentiation, stopping when the correct structure is complete (Birnbaum and Sánchez Alvarado, 2008). While cells navigate transcriptional and metabolic spaces, cellular collectives can navigate anatomical morphospaces and the conventional behavioural space (Fields and Levin, 2022).",

    "text": "Altered states: Basal cognition and manipulated target morphology. This framework makes a strong prediction: if intercellular signalling (not genes) is the cognitive medium of a morphogenetic individual, it should be possible to exploit the tools of behavioural and neuro-science and learn to read, interpret and re-write its information content in a way that allows predictive control over its behaviour (in this case, growth and form) without genetic changes. This prediction has been validated in several species. The bioelectric signatures that drive accurate regenerative reproduction/development in planaria have been identified (‘reading and interpreting’ anatomical target information, Durant et al., 2016; Durant et al., 2017; Pezzulo et al., 2021). Planaria normally have one head, but this is not genetically determined, merely a default: transient bioelectrical modulation of the body-wide pattern memory circuits can shift them to a persistent two-headed state, causing subsequent pieces of that planarian to regenerate into two-headed worms (‘re-writing’) (Durant et al., 2016). This induced phenotype then persists through future rounds of amputation until set back to normal with a different bioelectrical manipulation (Durant et al., 2017); it even exhibits features of advanced individual cognition such as bi-stability (Pezzulo et al., 2021). These target morphology shifts occur despite the fact that all of the individual cells have unaltered normal genomes, showing that competent subunits can be pushed to implement diverse organism-scale goals by physiological signals (experiences) without modification of their essential hardware. In addition, this can happen rapidly – not requiring evolutionary timeframes. Other examples of reading, interpreting and re-writing the bioelectric information dictating morphogenesis have been described in a range of model systems (Levin, 2021b). Consistent with the idea that cellular swarms can act as a consolidated cognitive agent, morphogenesis is known to be altered by prior experiences (e.g. amphibian limbs ceasing to regenerate after repeated amputation (Bryant et al., 2017)) and confused by exposure to classic cognitive modifier drugs (Sullivan and Levin, 2016).",

But it’s crucial to note that the very same cognitive glue – bioelectrical networks implemented by ion channels and electrical synapses – operates to bind neurons into competent individuals in the 3D world of behaviour and to bind other cell types into competent individuals in the morphogenetic space of anatomical control. These insights are now driving computational models used to understand the tissue-level decision making that results in birth defects (Manicka and Levin, 2019b, 2022) and their repair (Pai et al., 2018; Pai et al., 2020; Pai and Levin, 2022), giving rise to promising therapeutics.\n\nThese capacities of morphogenetic cellular collectives are basally cognitive insomuch as they involve information integration and coordinated action (Fields and Levin, 2020; Grossberg, 1978; Levin, 2019; Manicka and Levin, 2019a; Newman and Bhat, 2008), characteristic of a self (Levin, 2019).

We thus investigate biologically motivated decentralized yet collective decision-making strategies of the swimming behavior of a generalized NG swimmer, serving as a simple model system for, e.g., a unicellular organism, or a controllable swimming microrobot. Optimizing collective tasks in systems of artificial agents, such as collectively moving composite (micro)-robots, can be addressed with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Typically employed concepts such as Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) often rely on the usage of overparameterized deep neural networks and complex information sharing across agents during training⁵⁵⁻⁵⁷. In contrast to conventional MARL we employ here a recently developed method⁵⁸,⁵⁹ which utilizes EAs to optimize lean decentralized control policies based on collective performance quantified by a global fitness signal (i.e., without the need for local credit assignment). Such collective agents have a topology reminiscent of Neural Cellular Automata⁶⁰,⁶¹ (NCAs), where all distributed agents share the same ANN architecture while exchanging low-bandwidth information between neighbors on the grid of a cellular automaton to update their states and hence the collective behavior in the problem domain; here, the beads of a generalized NG swimmer will be treated as the cells of an NCA which will learn to coordinate locally to exert non-reciprocal bead-specific forces to propagate the collective microswimmer body. Furthermore, in our approach, we are able to overcome earlier limitations by extending our swimmers to much larger N than previously feasible, allowing us to identify locomotion strategies in the limit N→∞. To this end, we interpret each bead of the microswimmer's body as an agent that can only perceive information about its adjacent beads and whose actions induce contractions or extensions of its adjacent muscles. We substitute the internal decision-making machinery of such single-bead agents with ANNs and employ genetic algorithms and neuroevolution to machine learn optimal policies for such single-bead decision-making centers, such that the entire N-bead swimmer can efficiently self-propel collectively, i.e., in a decentralized way. We show that the evolved policies are robust and failure-tolerant concerning morphological changes of the collective microswimmer and that such decentralized control—trained for microswimmers with a specific number of beads—generalizes well to vastly different morphologies.",

These beads are connected pairwise by massless arms of length lᵢ(tₖ) = xᵢ₊₁(tₖ) - xᵢ(tₖ), as illustrated in Fig. 1a.

Yet, these bead-specific agents follow a shared objective to collectively self-propel the entire N-bead swimmer's body.

Moreover, each bead maintains an internal vector-valued state, sᵢ(tₖ). This state can be utilized by the respective controller to store, update, and actively share recurrent information with other beads that is not necessarily bound to the physical state of the swimmer but an emergent property of the collective RL system: Every controller thus perceives its neighboring states, Sᵢ(tₖ) = {sᵢ₋₁(tₖ), sᵢ(tₖ), sᵢ₊₁(tₖ)}, which additionally guide the agent's decision-making (see \"Methods” and ref. ⁵⁸ for details).

    "text": "To model a force-free swimmer, we propose two different methods of how the mapping between the proposed forces Φᵢ(tₖ), and the actual active forces Fₐ(tₖ), is achieved: First, we interpret the proposed forces as pairwise arm forces Φᵢ(tₖ) and -Φᵢ(tₖ) applied between two consecutive beads i and i + 1, respectively (see Fig. 2a). This leads to the actual active forces Fₐ(tₖ) = Φᵢ(tₖ) - Φᵢ₋₁(tₖ) for beads i = 1..., N, where we treat the swimmer's \"head\" and \"tail\" separately by setting Φₙ(tₖ) = 0 and introducing Φ₀(tₖ) = 0. This automatically ensures ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿFᵢ(tₖ) = 0. In this sense, the proposed actions can be understood as local decisions to expand/contract muscles between the beads where the maximum local power input on a bead is constrained and set by the value of F₀. Second, we assume that the proposed force Φᵢ(tₖ) of every controller directly targets the actual force applied to its associated bead, but, to fulfill the force-free condition, we subtract the mean Φ̄(tₖ) = ¹⁄ₙ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿΦᵢ(tₖ) from every proposed force and arrive at Fₐ(tₖ) = Φᵢ(tₖ) - Φ̄(tₖ) (see Fig. 2b). Hence the first approach ensures the global force-free condition via a series of locally annihilating pair-forces motivated by biological force dipole generation at small scales that cause the arms between the corresponding beads i and (i + 1) to contract or extend. In turn, the second approach regularizes the forces by collective feedback (via Φ̄(tₖ)) and can be interpreted as a mean-field approach that may be utilized by external controllers for artificial microswimmers⁵³. Henceforth, we refer to the first scenario as type A, and to the second scenario as type B microswimmers, and alike for the corresponding self-navigation strategies or policies. We note that for both type A and B microswimmers the total force per bead is constrained to Fᵢ(tₖ) ∈ [-2F₀, 2F₀], except for the first and last bead of type A which are only connected to a single muscle such that for type A swimmers F₁(tₖ) and Fₙ(tₖ) ∈ [-F₀, F₀].",

In general, such a policy is a complicated and complex function of the input, and ANNs as universal function approximators are well-suited tools to parameterize these objects for arbitrary agents and environments (see Methods). Thus, we approximate the RL agent's policy πᵢ by an ANN, formally expressed as a function fθ(·) with parameters θ, such that aᵢ(tₖ) = fθ(pᵢ(tₖ)). More specifically, we treat a single N-bead swimmer as a multi-agent system, each bead being equipped with a functionally identical but operationally independent ANN-based controller, fθ(·). This renders the system reminiscent of a Neural Cellular Automaton (NCA) with the extension that the decentralized actions of all individual controllers give rise to a collective locomotion policy Π = {π₁, ..., πₙ} ≈ {fθ(p₁(tₖ)), ..., fθ(pₙ(tₖ))}, of the entire virtual organism (see also ref. ⁵⁹). Here, only a single set of parameters θ is used for all N bead-specific agents, i.e., the same ANN controller is deployed to every bead; the states of the latter only differ in their initial conditions and subsequent input-output-history.

More specifically, we carefully optimize ANN policies for a particular number of Nₜ = 3 to 100 beads (as discussed above) and deploy them—without any retraining or further adaptation—into microswimmer bodies with a different number of N = 3 to 300 beads instead to evaluate the corresponding swimming velocities for such cross-policy environments.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4a, b, we find that the vast majority of all policies that are most optimal for a particular value of Nₜ are also highly effective in self-propelling microswimmers with N ≠ Nₜ for both type A and B, respectively. This even holds for situations where Nₜ <<N, such as Nₜ = 3 and N = 300. We did not explicitly optimize for this property at all, but it is an emergent phenomenon of the inherent decentralized decision-making of the system. Thus, the collective nature of the proposed swimming policies renders the evolved locomotive strategies highly adaptive to morphological changes, irrespective of the specific number of beads N used during deployment. Only for a few situations which can occur when the number of beads N deviates significantly from the number of beads Nₜ used during training, do not lead to successful swimming, in particular for type B microswimmers (Fig. 4b).
