Many microorganisms swim by performing larger non-reciprocal shape deformations that are initiated locally by molecular motors. However, it remains unclear how decentralized shape control determines the movement of the entire organism. Here, we investigate how efficient locomotion emerges from coordinated yet simple and decentralized decision-making of the body parts using neuroevolution techniques. Our approach allows us to investigate optimal locomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies, with emerging long-wavelength body shape deformations corresponding to surprisingly efficient swimming gaits. The obtained decentralized policies are robust and tolerant concerning morphological changes or defects and can be applied to artificial microswimmers for cargo transport or drug delivery applications without further optimization \"out of the box\". Our work is of relevance to understanding and developing robust navigation strategies of biological and artificial microswimmers and, in a broader context, for understanding emergent levels of individuality and the role of collective intelligence in Artificial Life.",

The proposed forces are limited to Φᵢ(tₖ) ∈ [-F₀, F₀] by clamping the controllers' force outputs to ±F₀, where F₀ sets the force scale in our system.

This leads to the actual active forces Fᵢᵃ(tₖ) = Φᵢ(tₖ) - Φᵢ₋₁(tₖ) for beads i = 1..., N, where we treat the swimmer's \"head\" and \"tail\" separately by setting Φₙ(tₖ) = 0 and introducing Φ₀(tₖ) = 0.

We treat a single N-bead swimmer as a multi-agent system, each bead being equipped with a functionally identical but operationally independent ANN-based controller, fθ(·).

We thus investigate here whether our decentralized locomotion policies, which are genuinely evolved for microswimmer bodies with exactly N₁ beads, generalize to morphological changes. More specifically, we carefully optimize ANN policies for a particular number of N₁ = 3 to 100 beads and deploy them-without any retraining or further adaptation-into microswimmer bodies with a different number of N = 3 to 300 beads instead to evaluate the corresponding swimming velocities for such cross-policy environments.

This even holds for situations where N₁ <<N, such as N₁ = 3 and N = 300. We did not explicitly optimize for this property at all, but it is an emergent phenomenon of the inherent decentralized decision-making of the system. Thus, the collective nature of the proposed swimming policies renders the evolved locomotive strategies highly adaptive to morphological changes, irrespective of the specific number of beads N used during deployment. Only for a few situations which can occur when the number of beads N deviates significantly from the number of beads N₁ used during training, do not lead to successful swimming, in particular for type B microswimmers.

Then, all arms oscillate at the same angular velocity ω and exhibit the same cross-correlation times τ to their neighboring arms, where lᵢ₊₁(tₖ) = lᵢ(tₖ - τ), and we can express each of the i = 1, ..., N arm lengths as a 2π-periodic function l̂ᵢ(t) = f ((t − iτ)ω̄ + φ), with the phase shift φ defining the initial conditions.

In contrast, in our work, we set local constraints on the swimmer by limiting the forces on every bead. Although we hence did not optimize in our RL procedure for the hydrodynamic efficiency η of our swimmers, we measure η determined by  η = 6πμR(eff)v̄²/P where P = ∫∑ᵢvᵢ(t)Fᵢ(t)dt is the stroke-averaged power consumption, and R(eff) is the effective radius of our swimmers.

    "text": "Since our evolved microswimmer policies show strong resilience even against significant morphological perturbations, we aim to investigate this operational plasticity even further: Exemplarily for the most optimal type A and B microswimmers with (N = 13), we systematically load the arms with extra passive \"cargo\" beads of variable radius R ∈ [0, 2R], and evaluate the dynamics of the corresponding loaded microswimmer consisting now of N = 13 + 1 beads, without retraining or further optimization. These cargo beads can geometrically be located between two neighboring beads of the microswimmer, but remain functionally disjoint from the latter (cargo beads are not connected by arms to any body beads): when placed at an arm lᵢ, a cargo bead does not disrupt the exchange of information between the corresponding beads i and (i + 1) and thus does not affect the inputs of the respective bead-specific ANNs. Since cargo beads are passive elements, they do not propose active forces independently, Fᵃ(t) = 0, and are moved around solely by the hydrodynamic interaction with the other beads and the restoring spring forces of nearby beads. This ensures that a cargo bead is topologically fixed in the microswimmer's body.",

    "text": "Figures 6a, b demonstrates, that our approach of utilizing decentralized, bead-specific controllers for N-bead microswimmer locomotion not only gives rise to highly robust self-propulsion policies but can also be used “out of the box” for cargo transport applications: We show that both type A and B microswimmers are capable of swimming while having additional cargo beads of various sizes located at different internal positions, i.e., at different arms along their main axes. While the presence of cargo beads significantly restrains the neighboring beads from adapting the adjacent arm length, essentially locking the corresponding arm, the remaining functional beads self-propel the entire microswimmer effectively. We further emphasize that, in general, the swimming speed decreases with increasing cargo size, Rc. Next, we successively fill all arms of a single microswimmer from the left, l₁, to the right, lₙ, simultaneously with a total number of N = 1, ..., (N − 1) cargo beads of equal radius Rc (one cargo per arm) and measure the speed of the correspondingly loaded (N+N)-bead microswimmers as a function of the number of loaded arms and cargo size. Both type A and B microswimmers are capable of transporting",
