In this report, we briefly overview the Cell Bio 2023 subgroup meeting “Bioelectricity in Development, Regeneration, and Cancers.\" This subgroup meeting featured 12 talks (7 Principal Investigators and 5 junior scientists) exploring the role of bioelectricity in endogenous and diseased states in model systems ranging from cells in culture to single-cell organisms such as yeast all the way to mammalian systems (including tools and technology developed for exploring bioelectricity and electrotaxis in cells and tissues). The subgroup meeting concluded with a discussion on the current challenges and opportunities for the field of bioelectricity.",

Her lab identified dorsoventrally asymmetric calcium (Ca2+) spikes in the neural tube, operating independently in the cytosol and primary cilia. Evidence suggests noncanonical Shh signal, acting through the TRPC3 channel, regulates Ca2+ in the primary cilia, influencing SOX2 and other neuronal markers to differentiate neural stem cells into neurons. This study highlights the integration of bioelectric signals with morphogen signals and gene-regulatory networks during embryonic development, an area ripe for further research.",

Anderson–Tawil syndrome, primarily causing neurological defects, also leads to craniofacial morphology defects, similar to those in mouse KCNJ2 channel knockout in neural crest cells.  Evidence showed disrupted BMP signaling in these loss-of-function animals despite the presence of all BMP components. KCNJ2-mediated membrane voltage (Vmem) depolarization triggers Ca2+ transients crucial for BMP release. KCNJ2 knockout mice lacked depolarization, Ca2+ transients, and BMP release, potentially causing craniofacial defects.",

These findings, along with other presented work, suggest that Vmem and Ca2+-mediated regulation of morphogen release is a conserved mechanism across tissues, potentially working with various morphogens to regulate embryonic development.",

Ectopic expression of five other K+ channels induced different fin morphologies, suggesting bioelectricity, rather than a specific channel, is key for fin development.",
