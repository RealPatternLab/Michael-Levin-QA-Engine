How does genomic information unfold, to give rise to self-constructing living organisms with problem-solving capacities at all levels of organization? We review recent progress that unifies work in developmental genetics and machine learning (ML) to understand mapping of genes to traits. We emphasize the deep symmetries between evolution and learning, which cast the genome as instantiating a generative model. The layer of physiological computations between genotype and phenotype provides a powerful degree of plasticity and robustness, not merely complexity and indirect mapping, which strongly impacts individual and evolutionary-scale dynamics. Ideas from ML and neuroscience now provide a versatile, quantitative formalism for understanding what evolution learns and how developmental and regenerative morphogenesis interpret the deep lessons of the past to solve new problems. This emerging understanding of the informational architecture of living material is poised to impact not only genetics and evolutionary developmental biology but also regenerative medicine and synthetic morphoengineering.

Whence the endless forms most beautiful?

Living forms present three fundamental challenges to our understanding: first, they self-assemble - performing all of the decision-making needed to construct a functional, complex body while the computational material itself is being reorganized on-the-fly. Second, they reach the correct target morphology reliably, utilizing heredity mechanisms to propagate specific patterns of form and behavior through time. Crucially, third, this process is almost never hard-wired, but instead offers immense plasticity, able to complete morphogenetic tasks despite perturbations of external environment and internal components [1]. This capacity to navigate the morphospace of possible anatomies, to produce the correct final pattern in the face of novel situations, or to create something completely different (never before seen by evolution) but nevertheless coherent and adaptively functional [2], is an example of problem-solving ability in a high-dimensional latent space. This lynchpin capacity ties together fields of evolutionary developmental biology, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, computational and information science, and the emerging field of diverse intelligence. The implications of understanding the multiscale behavior of the active matter of life during embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer suppression range across biomedicine, bioengineering, robotics, and bio-inspired artificial intelligence (AI). Central to this set of questions is the relationship between the genetically specified hardware inside cells and the resulting physiological software that produces phenotypes acted upon by selection. Given the plasticity and context-sensitive decision-making of the all-important morphogenetic layer lying between genotype and phenotype, what are useful conceptual frameworks for understanding what genomes actually do (or encode), on evolutionary and ontogenic timescales?

A new perspective: the generative genome

Recent work integrating developmental biology and computer science has provided a new model of how genetic information is encoded and decoded during evolution and embryogenesis. Concepts from biology, neuroscience, and AI now offer a formalizable and timely framework that could advance both theoretical and empirical research [3–5]. Here, we provide a brief overview of related ideas and ways to extend this approach in theoretical and experimental biology.

Evolution through developmental reproduction involves encoding the features and functionality necessary for high-fidelity reconstruction of an organism out of the compact form of the genome. The genome does not encode organismal traits or developmental processes directly (it encodes the protein-level hardware necessary for cell behavior and information processing). The new ideas being developed try to go beyond ‘blueprint’ or ‘program’ metaphors and instead identify the genome as compressed latent variables – analogous to Waddington's gene landscape and biologically implemented via protein-encoding sequences and gene regulatory factors – that instantiate organismal development literally as a generative model [3]. It is hypothesized that the genome comprises compressed latent variables that are shaped or encoded by evolution and natural selection, and decoded by a generative model implemented by the cells of the developing embryo that is strikingly similar to the way information is processed in biological and engineered cognitive systems [3,6]. Development can thus be interpreted as a hierarchical generative decoding process from a single cell into a mature organism that is similar but not identical to its ancestors, a reconstruction with variational adaptations and mutations, but also dynamic and flexible interpretation of past information as suitable for new contexts [6]. As we argue later, this kind of architecture enables not only fidelity (reliability) in reaching the correct species-specific target morphology, but also creative problem-solving that maximizes adaptive saliency to new scenarios, not just hardwired replication of what was successful with prior environments and genetics. The line of thinking described herein integrates across scales of space and time, identifying this flexible, creative process as conserved across evolutionary, developmental, and behavioral contexts.

Evolutionary development as generative model

In ML terms, such an architecture is reminiscent of variational autoencoders (VAEs) [7–10], two-stage artificial neural networks (ANNs) [11–15] consisting of an encoder and a decoder part (Figure 1A). The encoder and decoder are jointly trained to compress input data into a lower-dimensional bottleneck representation, from which the original data is reconstructed via decompression. Typically, the decoding-stack of VAEs occurs hierarchically, going from abstract representations through adding modular features to detailed reconstructions of the original data, closely resembling, in turn, the developmental stack of embryogenesis. The latent space can capture emergent properties of the data, such as clusters or manifolds that represent different classes or features (modularity). Generative models, including VAEs, generate data by sampling from this latent space, variational latent variables allowing for the creation of novel examples conforming but not identical to the training data (adaptation). Thus, generative processes relying on compressed latent variables arguably leverage modularity and evolvability in developmental biology. Such work speaks to the fundamental question of the meaning of ‘genetics’ - what precisely is encoded in the biochemical medium of the genes and how is it read out and interpreted by the active cellular material whose hardware it specifies?

Extending the autoencoder analogy

This new framework focuses on the powerful idea of interpreting the genome as latent variables of a generative model. The assertion that DNA instantiates a generative model of the organism [3] has been actively debated [4–6,16–19]. However, authors differ as to whether their proposed generative model covers: (i) the entire developmental stack from the genome to the organism, or targets (ii) a single decoding layer between the genome and a cellular phenotype. This raises questions about how such a model might be applied across different scales of biological organization (cf. Figure 1B):

(i) Biology is organized in layers within layers of abstraction, where the components of each organizational level efficiently navigate their respective problem domains [5,16,17], including metabolic, transcriptomic, physiological, anatomical, and behavioral state spaces. More than that: biological agents, even those comprising the same organism continuously influence (i.e., ‘hack’) each other either in symbiotic or adversarial relations, including among the organs of a single organism [20–22].

(ii) Even individual cells dynamically respond to environmental cues but can also reconfigure internally via gene regulatory networks (GRNs), displaying significant structural and operational plasticity, including several different kinds of learning [4,5,18,23].

VAEs are single-shot generators with limited generative variability stemming from noise applied at the latent space level. The subsequent decoder is a deterministic downstream process with no room for further variability or creativity. By contrast, organismal development is inherently distributed with a collective of agents constantly reinterpreting and reacting to signals and noise across scales [5,18]. Following the VAE metaphor, this is fundamentally different from variations only in the latent space, and would rather affect every node within the decoder, massively departing from the typical deterministic downstream decoding processes. Moreover, embryonic viability requires adherence to stringent physiological and energetic criteria throughout development, while vanilla VAEs do not enforce physical constraints on intermediate states during decoding.

The hierarchical and recurrent complexity and multiplicity of the genetically instantiated generative model of organismal development poses significant challenges for current ML architectures, greatly departing from the VAE analogy. Here, we intend to expand on the more general generative model framework and discuss inherently collective self-regulatory ML approaches bridging the gap between artificial and biological life.

From bowties to Darwin's agential material
One exciting aspect of using deep concepts from ML to shed light on biology is that it provides a rigorous formalism for unifying dynamics of cognitive and morphological change. The idea that the self-assembly of the body had important symmetries with the construction of minds must have already been apparent to Turing, who famously was not only interested in unconventional embodiments of intelligence and patterns of mental activity [24] but also in the self-assembly of structural patterns during development [25]. Another notable contribution to this field was Grossberg’s prescient ‘Communication, memory, and development’ [26]. However, advances in connectionist approaches to problem-solving in synthetic media have provided more specific architectural principles around which somatic and cognitive competency can be organized. [27–32]

Starting in 2016, Pezzulo and Levin [4] discussed how top-down approaches, such as the free energy principle (FEP) [33–36], can model developmental processes through nested bowtie architectures (i.e., where diverse molecular mechanisms converge on critical intermediates to achieve high-level goals through distributed self-orchestration). This concept highlights the efficiency and robustness of the generative developmental and evolutionary process of biological systems. Subsequent works [16,17] further explore scale-free and hierarchical dynamics in development, emphasizing the FEP’s unifying role in evolution and development and introducing the concept of biology as a multiscale competency architecture (MCA), with causal top-down and bottom-up control pathways. They specifically proposed that tissue, organs, organ systems, and other levels of biological organization arise as the generalization of compressed information at molecular levels, as occurs in multilayer ANNs, and framed regeneration as a kind of pattern completion task [37] (see Box 1 for explanations of computer science terms).

This led to the idea that each individual within an MCA is an autonomous agent, actively navigating their respective environments and problem spaces [17]. In turn, a unified approach to understanding biological self-organization is arguably rooted in localized homeostatic agents following cooperatively coordinated error correction principles (Figure 1C).

Although somatic cells have been domesticated by multicellularity, and their behavior is regulated by many exogenous factors in vivo to align them toward large-scale setpoints at the organ and tissue level, they navigate physiological, transcriptional, metabolic, and anatomical problem spaces under the influence of their own priors as well as of cues from the local and remote internal environment [18]. Thus, a critical missing piece in our understanding of development and evolution is the fact evolution operates on an agential material, not passive, or even merely active, matter: cells can integrate multiple modalities of sensory data and make context-sensitive decisions [38–41], and even the molecular networks inside of cells can implement several different kinds of learning, including Pavlovian conditioning [23,42,43].

The various competencies of cells and subcellular components, in terms of problem-solving, memory, and flexible, context-sensitive navigation of physiological and anatomical landscapes have been reviewed elsewhere [44–47]. We argue that an organism’s genotype and phenotype are connected by an agential layer of irreducible physiological computation, fundamentally implemented by self-orchestrated biological agents that are – at all scales – capable of dealing with novel situations on the fly [5]. Moreover, such an MCA demonstratively [48–50] impacts the process of an underlying evolutionary process operating on the structural and functional plasticity of an agential substrate, leading to more efficient and robust evolutionary and developmental search dynamics, adaptability, transferability, and evolvability.

Generative bowties everywhere

Mitchell and Cheney [3] identify the genome as latent variables of a generative model for organismal development that is facilitated through GRNs and shaped by evolution. Their proposed VAE architecture leverages developmental plasticity through complexity of the connectionist decoder stack, and evolvability through variability in latent variables. By contrast and complement, our framework [4–6,16–19] emphasizes the fundamental role of goal-directed problem-solving and collective intelligence of biological systems across scales in developmental and evolutionary pathways.
