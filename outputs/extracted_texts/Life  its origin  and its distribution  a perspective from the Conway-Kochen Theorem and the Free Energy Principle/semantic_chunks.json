    "text": "We argue here that the Origin of Life (OOL) problem is not just a chemistry problem but is also, and primarily, a cognitive science problem. When interpreted through the lens of the Conway-Kochen theorem and the Free Energy Principle, contemporary physics characterizes all complex dynamical systems that persist through time as Bayesian agents. If all persistent systems are to some - perhaps only minimal – extent cognitive, are all persistent systems to some extent alive, or are living systems only a subset of cognitive systems? We argue that no bright line can be drawn, and we re-assess, from this perspective, the Fermi paradox and the Drake equation. We conclude that improving our abilities to recognize and communicate with diverse intelligences in diverse embodiments, whether based on familiar biochemistry or not, will either resolve or obviate the OOL problem.",

    "text": "The Origin of Life (OOL) problem is ordinarily thought of as a chemistry problem: how can the right molecules, under the right conditions, be compartmentalized in a way that initiates an autocatalytic process that maintains not just the right molecular concentrations, but also the enabling conditions and the requisite compartmentalization? Many ideas have been suggested, typically focused on either autocatalysis or compartmentalization as the primary problem. It is widely believed that multiple OOL events could have occurred on the early Earth, with only one lineage – that of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all known life – surviving. It is also widely believed that OOL events could occur elsewhere, prompting searches for evidence of extraterrestrial life by various means.\n\nThe OOL event leading to LUCA and its lineage is important in a number of related fields. First, it represents an originating singularity that must back-stop the reproductive cycle that is a cornerstone of evolutionary biology. Second, by effectively defining \"synthetic\" life, it sets a boundary condition on synthetic biology and bioengineering, both efforts to create and study life-as-it-could be in novel implementations. Third, it is a critical fixed point for exo-biology, pushing us to define what it is that we are looking for on worlds beyond our planet, and to construct models of what different origin stories would mean for the further development of complexity and intelligence. Most crucially, it strongly impacts the very definition of \"life\": a standard account in which life is a distinct category set apart from non-living matter is challenged by the need to identify and explain a sharp phase transition in which life arose from non-life. Related to this are questions of the relationship of life and mind. Whatever theories we formulate for the minimal dynamics needed to create minds, it is imperative to understand their relationship to the OOL. The conventional view is that cognition arose at some point during life's expansion along an axis of complexity, i.e. that cognitive beings are a subset of living beings.",

    "text": "Here, we review an alternative way of thinking about the OOL problem that is motivated by the Conway-Kochen (CK) theorem, a result in fundamental physics, and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), a theoretical framework that originated in neuroscience and has been extended over the past decade into a description of generic physical systems. The CK theorem characterizes all physical systems as agential in the specific sense of displaying behavior that is not, even in principle, predictable from local causal influences. The FEP characterizes all physical systems as inferential in the specific sense of behaving as Bayesian satisficers. Together, the CK theorem and the FEP suggest a view of cognition that is substantially broader than mainstream views in biology, and may even surprise advocates of basal cognition in, e.g. plants or microbes. They suggest, in particular, that all complex systems are organizations of agential materials that perform Bayesian satisficing on multiple scales. This in turn suggests that the OOL problem is not, or at least not just, a chemistry problem, but is rather a cognitive science problem: the problem of characterizing the level or type of cognition at which it becomes meaningful for a system to be considered living. It raises the questions of whether life and cognition are co-extensive, as many have argued, and of what specific attributes distinguish living cognitive systems from non-living cognitive systems if they are not. It suggests that developing methods to both identify and communicate with diverse intelligences with diverse embodiments that exhibit behavior in diverse state spaces will be required to fully address the OOL problem.\nWe first review the CK theorem in § 2 and the FEP in § 3. We then consider the fundamental question of whether life is co-extensive with cognition in § 4. We discuss the extraordinary range of possible embodiments, over essentially arbitrary spatial and temporal scales, that become available when the materials available in the universe are considered agential. We also consider the variety of state spaces that such systems may traverse over their \"life-spans\", some of which may be only minimally coupled to our familiar three-dimensional (3d) embedding space in which the overt behavior of familiar organisms unfolds. We formulate typical criteria for life, including reproduction with variation and autopoietic metabolism, in ways that can be applied to diverse embodiments inhabiting diverse state spaces. We then turn in § 5 to Enrico Fermi's famous \"Where are they?\" question, and discuss the kinds of communication capabilities we might expect diverse cognitive systems which we may or may not consider to be \"alive\" to be capable of employing.",

    "text": "In 2006, John Conway and Simon Kochen published their \"free will theorem\"; they published a more general, and hence stronger, version in 2009. The CK theorem concerns interactions between an observer and some system of interest that comply with both Special Relativity (SR) and Quantum Theory (QT). The former requires that interactions between system and observer are causal, in the specific sense of transferring information between systems i) forward in time and ii) at no more than the speed of light; indeed compliance with these two conditions define \"causality\" in SR. \n\nThe CK theorem in its original form states that in any observational situation compliant with SR and QT, if the actions of the observer at some time t₁ are not completely determined by the events in the observer's past light cone at that time, then the observed system's response, at some t₂>t₁, to the observer's actions at t₁, are not completely determined by the events in the system's past light cone at t₂. The proof is somewhat involved, and depends on the earlier Kochen-Specker theorem showing that observations compliant with QT exhibit non-causal dependencies on context. The underlying intuition, however, is straightforward: the evolution of the quantum state of part of the universe can only be fully understood as a projection of the evolution of the quantum state of the entire universe. Local information, e.g. the information available from a past light cone, is never sufficient to completely specify a quantum state; this insufficiency of local information also underlies the Wootters-Zurek \"no-cloning\" theorem. This is particularly clear in the case of spatially extended systems in entangled states, in which spacelike-separated components of a single system appear, in the laboratory reference frame of an observer, to have distinct past light cones. The insufficiency of local information for quantum state specification applies to both the observer and the observed system, replacing the \"if then\" formulation of the original theorem with the stronger formulation of the 2009 version.",

    "text": "The CK theorem shows us that, at least in the context of current fundamental physics, all systems exhibit one of the typical hallmarks of living systems: their resistance to local, causal determination of behavior, and hence their ability to act in ways that are surprising. It is possible to write this off as \"randomness” or “stochasticity\" and hence to view it in essentially thermodynamic terms, but we note that doing so already provides the minimal requirement – a degree of autonomy for a system to exist on the spectrum of agency, which can then be scaled up into higher forms of intelligence (with greater historicity, metacognition, etc.) by the processes of evolution or engineering. Here, we follow Wheeler, Fuchs, and others in interpreting the CK theorem, and indeed QT generally, as implying that all systems have a fundamentally agentic character. We will describe one way of formulating this in the next section: if two systems are distinguishable – formally, if their joint state is not entangled – they have independent and hence \"free\" choice of computations to perform on, and hence semantics to assign to, their inputs. That such freedom of interpretation is the basis of agency is a key tenant of 2nd-order cybernetics.",

    "text": "The FEP describes the behavior of physical systems that can be distinguished from the environments in which they are embedded, and provides a criterion that such systems must satisfy in order to remain distinguishable from their environments over some period of time. It can be stated, in obviously tautological form, as the claim that any system that is distinguishable from its environment must behave in a way that maintains its distinguishability from its environment, from the perspective of an external observer, and possibly from its own perspective. More technically, any such system must behave in a way that maintains the conditional statistical independence of its states from the states of its environment. The FEP describes the maintenance of conditional statistical independence as the asymptotic minimization of a variational free energy (VFE) measured at the system environment boundary, and describes the minimization of VFE as Bayesian satisficing. Intuitively, VFE is a measure of the system's uncertainty about what its environment will do to it next; hence VFE can be interpreted as a measure of the stress imposed on the system by its environment, and Bayesian satisficing can be interpreted as deciding how best to relieve this stress. The FEP can thus be viewed as providing a dictionary for translating descriptions of behavior in the languages of either classical dynamical systems or QT into the languages of the cognitive, and when many agents are involved, the social sciences. We will, in what follows, consistently use the term “agent” to refer to a system compliant with both the CK theorem and the FEP, recognizing that the scope of this usage comprises all physical systems that remain distinct from their environments over some time period of interest, and that this scope is considerably broader than that of some other usages of this term; see [41] for a general review and [42] for a review specific to biology. The FEP is based on the recognition that the internal processes implemented by S and E which we will denote by the Hamiltonian operators Hs and HE, respectively, that implement these processes in QT can be viewed as representations, or in statistical language, generative models, of the interaction HSE. For any system that implements a generative model of its interaction with its environment effectively, a generative model of its expected inputs and available outputs - departures from model expectations can be represented by a variational approximation, namely a VFE [40]; again see [11] for a formulation in the current setting. The maintenance of HSE within homeostatic bounds by the actions of Hs and He can, therefore, be represented as minimization of this VFE. Minimization of VFE over inputs can, however, be represented formally as Bayesian satisficing; hence the actions of Hs and He can be viewed as Bayesian satisficing, and the systems S and E can be viewed as Bayesian agents. In FEP language, S and E engage, at all times, in active inference, both adjusting their generative models to account for incoming data and acting on each other to maintain their incoming data within model-expected bounds, i.e. within the bounds required to maintain separability.",

The FEP originated as a theory of living systems, and it generates many identified features of life from its minimal physical assumptions. If the FEP does generically describe life, where does this leave the OOL problem? Was there just one origin of life, at the Big Bang? Or are OOL events ubiquitous, occurring wherever organic or any other chemistry is available to generate complexity? If the FEP does not generically describe life, i.e. if living systems are some proper subset of agentive, cognitive systems, what must be added to the properties and capabilities that the FEP does render generic to produce a definition of life, and how can such additions be squared with the increasingly blurry lines between naturally-evolved systems and bio-engineered constructs? Is, in other words, \"life\" an ontological category, or an interpretive construct? One could, following [56], argue that such questions do not and even cannot matter.
