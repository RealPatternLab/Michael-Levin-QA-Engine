from the Conway-Kochen Theorem and the Free
Energy Principle
Chris Fields & Michael Levin

[PAGE 2] ABSTRACT
We argue here that the Origin of Life (OOL) problem is not just a chemistry problem but is also, and primarily, a cognitive science problem. When interpreted through the lens of the Conway-Kochen theorem and the Free Energy Principle, contemporary physics characterizes all complex dynamical systems that persist through time as Bayesian agents. If all persistent systems are to some - perhaps only minimal – extent cognitive, are all persistent systems to some extent alive, or are living systems only a subset of cognitive systems? We argue that no bright line can be drawn, and we re-assess, from this perspective, the Fermi paradox and the Drake equation. We conclude that improving our abilities to recognize and communicate with diverse intelligences in diverse embodiments, whether based on familiar biochemistry or not, will either resolve or obviate the OOL problem.

[PAGE 2] 1. Introduction
The Origin of Life (OOL) problem is ordinarily thought of as a chemistry problem [1]: how can the right molecules, under the right conditions, be compartmentalized in a way that initiates an autocatalytic process that maintains not just the right molecular concentrations, but also the enabling conditions and the requisite compartmentalization? Many ideas have been suggested, typically focused on either autocatalysis or compartmentalization as the primary problem. It is widely believed that multiple OOL events could have occurred on the early Earth, with only one lineage – that of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all known life – surviving [2-4]. It is also widely believed that OOL events could occur elsewhere, prompting searches for evidence of extraterrestrial life by various means.
The OOL event leading to LUCA and its lineage is important in a number of related fields. First, it represents an originating singularity that must back-stop the reproductive cycle that is a cornerstone of evolutionary biology. Second, by effectively defining "synthetic" life, it sets a boundary condition on synthetic biology and bioengineering, both efforts to create and study life-as-it-could be [5] in novel implementations. Third, it is a critical fixed point for exo-biology, pushing us to define what it is that we are looking for on worlds beyond our planet, and to construct models of what different origin stories would mean for the further development of complexity and intelligence. Most crucially, it strongly impacts the very definition of "life": a standard account in which life is a distinct category set apart from non-living matter is challenged by the need to identify and explain a sharp phase transition in which life arose from non-life. Related to this are questions of the relationship of life and mind. Whatever theories we formulate for the minimal dynamics needed to create minds, it is imperative to understand their relationship to the OOL. The conventional view is that cognition arose at some point during life's expansion along an axis of complexity, i.e. that cognitive beings are a subset of living beings [6].
Here, we review an alternative way of thinking about the OOL problem that is motivated by the Conway-Kochen (CK) theorem [7,8], a result in fundamental physics, and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), a theoretical framework that originated in neuroscience [9,10] and has been extended over the past decade into a description of generic physical systems [11-16]. The CK theorem characterizes all physical systems as agential in the specific sense of displaying behavior that is not, even in principle, predictable from local causal influences. The FEP characterizes all physical systems as inferential in the specific sense of behaving as Bayesian satisficers. Together, the CK theorem and the FEP suggest a view of cognition that is substantially broader than mainstream views in biology, e.g. as represented in [6], and may even surprise advocates of basal cognition in, e.g. plants or microbes [17-21]. They suggest, in particular, that all complex systems are organizations of agential materials that perform Bayesian satisficing on multiple scales [22-24]. This in turn suggests that the OOL problem is not, or at least not just, a chemistry problem, but is rather a cognitive science problem: the problem of characterizing the level or type of cognition at which it becomes meaningful for a system to be considered living. It raises the questions of whether life and cognition are co-extensive, as many have argued [25-28], and of what specific attributes distinguish living cognitive systems from non-living cognitive systems if they are not. It suggests that developing methods to both identify and communicate with diverse intelligences with diverse embodiments that exhibit behavior in diverse state spaces [22,29–31] will be required to fully address the OOL problem.
We first review the CK theorem in § 2 and the FEP in § 3. We then consider the fundamental question of whether life is co-extensive with cognition in § 4. We discuss the extraordinary range of possible embodiments, over essentially arbitrary spatial and temporal scales, that become available when the materials available in the universe are considered agential. We also consider the variety of state spaces that such systems may traverse over their "life-spans", some of which may be only minimally coupled to our familiar three-dimensional (3d) embedding space in which the overt behavior of familiar organisms unfolds. We formulate typical criteria for life, including reproduction with variation and autopoietic metabolism, in ways that can be applied to diverse embodiments inhabiting diverse state spaces. We then turn in § 5 to Enrico Fermi's famous "Where are they?" question, and discuss the kinds of communication capabilities we might expect diverse cognitive systems which we may or may not consider to be "alive" to be capable of employing.

[PAGE 3] 2. The Conway-Kochen theorem as a generic characterization of agency
In 2006, John Conway and Simon Kochen published their "free will theorem"; they published a more general, and hence stronger, version in 2009. The CK theorem concerns interactions between an observer and some system of interest that comply with both Special Relativity (SR) and Quantum Theory (QT). The former requires that interactions between system and observer are causal, in the specific sense of transferring information between systems i) forward in time and ii) at no more than the speed of light; indeed compliance with these two conditions define "causality" in SR. 

[PAGE 4] 3. The FEP as a generic characterization of cognition
The FEP describes the behavior of physical systems that can be distinguished from the environments in which they are embedded, and provides a criterion that such systems must satisfy in order to remain distinguishable from their environments over some period of time.

[PAGE 6] 4. Life = Cognition, or Life ⊂ Cognition?
By recasting fundamental physics in agentive language in a way that applies to all time-persistent systems, the CK theorem and the FEP erase any "bright lines" separating cognitive systems from the "merely physical" while providing a natural association between dynamic and cognitive complexity.

[PAGE 7] 5. Where are they?
The Fermi Paradox – why we have never observed evidence of intelligent extraterrestrial life even though the observable universe is large enough that we might expect to – has been widely discussed since [72].

[PAGE 8] 6. The Drake Equation in light of the FEP
The Drake Equation estimates the number N of extraterrestrial intelligent systems detectable from Earth as N = RfpnefififcL, where R is the rate of star formation, fp is the fraction of stars with planets, ne is the number of life-supporting planets per such star, fi, fi, and fc are the fractions of such planets that develop life, intelligent life, and technological cultures respectively, and L is the average time a technological culture is detectable [73].

[PAGE 9] 7. Conclusions
The OOL problem has been framed against a background of classical physics operating in classical spacetime, and assumes an abiotic environment that operates as a classical mechanism. The Conway-Kochen theorem and the Free Energy Principle challenge these assumptions, the former by showing that local determinism conflicts with known physics, and the latter by providing a formal interpretation of even classical dynamical systems as Bayesian agents. Taken together, the CK theorem and the FEP characterize physical systems as at least minimally agentive at every scale, and suggest that life, cognition, and complexity are both inseparable and ubiquitous. If this is the case, the OOL problem is replaced, in practice, with the problem of recognizing and successfully interacting with diverse intelligences in diverse embodiments, which may, but may not, involve familiar biochemistry.
