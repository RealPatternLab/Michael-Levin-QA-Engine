    "text": "The scientific enterprise depends critically not only on the skills needed to definitively test crisp hypotheses, but also on the less well-understood step of acquiring insights and fruitful research directions.  While modern \"big data\" methods are generating a deluge of facts and measurements, it is increasingly important to develop strategies for deriving novel insights and deep hypotheses that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.  We must improve our ability to identify symmetries between sets of observations and unify and simplify by identifying large-scale patterns in research literature to motivate and enhance new research programs.",

It is essential for progress in bioinformatics, particularly understanding organism-level form and function, and developmental biology.  While much emphasis is placed on the factuality of AI output, the process of generating interesting hypotheses is less understood but equally crucial. This work attempts to bolster the ideation component of the scientific process with a new AI-based tool for generating hypotheses.",

Neuroscience and developmental biology, while distinct fields, may share underlying dynamics. Neuroscience recognizes that behavior and cognition are driven by neural networks signaling via electrical events.  Developmental biology shows that bioelectric signaling is crucial for directing complex morphogenesis. Recent advances in molecular understanding of developmental bioelectricity are blurring the lines between these disciplines.",

This shared algorithm for scaling cellular activity into larger competencies, such as morphogenesis and intelligent behavior, has implications for porting methods from neuroscience to biomedicine. This symmetry between cellular swarms in anatomical and behavioral spaces has been empirically tested but lacks tools for deriving hypotheses from the literature of neuroscience and developmental biophysics.",
