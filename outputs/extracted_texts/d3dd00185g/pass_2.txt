Machine learning for hypothesis generation in biology and
medicine: exploring the latent space of neuroscience and
developmental bioelectricity

[PAGE 2] Introduction
The scientific enterprise depends critically not only on the skills
needed to definitively test crisp hypotheses,1-7 but also on the
much less well-understood step of acquiring insights and
fruitful research directions.⁸ Many recent discussions¹⁰,¹¹ have
focused on the fact that while modern "big data" methods are
generating a deluge of facts and measurements, it is increas-
ingly more important to be “building the edifice of science, in
addition to throwing bricks into the yard".¹² In other words, it is
essential that we develop strategies for deriving novel insights
and deep hypotheses that cross traditional (in many cases,
artificial) boundaries between disciplines. We must improve, at
a pace that keeps up with technological and data science
advances, our ability to identify symmetries (invariances)
between sets of observations and approaches to unify and
simplify where possible by identifying large-scale patterns in
research literature and thus motivate and enhance new research
programs (Fig. 1).
One set of tools that is being rapidly developed and ubiqui-
tously deployed originates in the advances of the field of arti-
ficial intelligence.¹³⁻¹⁵ Machine learning is clearly poised to help
science.¹⁴,¹⁶⁻¹⁹ It is becoming widely recognized that “robot
scientist" platforms can not only provide number crunching,
automation, and high throughput, but could potentially also
guide research by identifying what experiments to do next.²⁰⁻²²
Machine learning tools have been suggested to be essential for
progress in the bioinformatics of shape²³⁻²⁶ (moving beyond
molecular information to understand organ- and organism-
level form and function), and developmental biology.²⁷,²⁸ Not
surprisingly, much emphasis is currently placed on improving
the factuality of the output of AI tools; this parallels the well-
developed notions of strong inference and hypothesis-testing
in science: the well-established algorithm of falsifying and
removing incorrect ideas. What is much less well-understood,
but ultimately as crucial, is the process that provides a pool of
interesting hypotheses from which to winnow until provisional
truths are found. Our contribution attempts to bolster this
second component of the scientific process – ideation – with
a new AI-based tool for human scientists that provides input
into the canonical scientific method.
Recent work in this field includes the AI-based discovery of
testable models of regenerative anatomical regulation,²⁹ which
were subsequently empirically validated,³⁰ and similar efforts in
genomics,²² chemistry³¹³² and biomaterials.³³ One of the most
potentially important current gaps is the paucity of tools for
assisting with the most creative aspect of the work: identifying
deep commonalities between disparate functional datasets, to
enable generalized insight from the ever-growing literature.
Tools are needed that would take meta-hypotheses of human
scientists and mine the published studies for information that
can be used to turn those conceptual hunches into actionable
research programs.

[PAGE 3] One interdisciplinary area
One interdisciplinary area in which computer-assisted
discovery would be most welcome is real-time physiology that
controls form and function in vivo. How large-scale anatomy and
behavior arises from the operation of molecular processes is
a canonical systems biology problem.³⁴ It is currently handled by
two distinct fields, with their own educational tracks, confer-
ences, journals, funding bodies, and paradigms: neuroscience
and developmental biology. Interestingly however, recent work
has suggested that these may share an important underlying set
of dynamics.35-37 Neuroscience has long understood that
behavior and cognition are driven by the physiological informa-
tion processing by neural networks, which signal via electrical
events at their membranes.38-41 Likewise, a long history of clas-
sical work has suggested that bioelectric signaling of all kinds of
cells is required as an instructive set of influences that help direct
complex developmental and regenerative morphogenesis.42-44
Interestingly, recent advances in the molecular understanding of
developmental bioelectricity45-47 has begun to blur the bound-
aries between those disciplines48,49 (Fig. 2).
Specifically, it has been conjectured that the immense
functional capabilities of brains have their origin in the more
ancient, and slower, bioelectric networks that began operation
at the emergence of bacterial biofilms50-54 and were heavily
exploited by evolution to orchestrate metazoan morphogen-
esis.55,56 The idea that the same algorithms for scaling cellular
activity into larger competencies (such as regulative morpho-
genesis and intelligent behavior) are used in the brain and in
the body (Fig. 3) has many deep implications, for example with
respect to porting methods from neuroscience and behavioral
science into biomedicine,35,57,58 to take advantage of neurosci-
ence's successful paradigms for managing multi-scale causality
and inferring effective interventions.
