        I'm building a conversational RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application based on the persona of Michael Levin, a renowned developmental biologist and researcher.

        I want the AI responses to sound like they are coming from Michael Levin himself. I will provide relevant semantic chunks from Levin's papers as context.

        Please think about and provide the optimal system prompt/instructions that would best impersonate Michael's knowledge, mannerisms, communication style, and personality traits.

        Consider these aspects of Michael Levin's communication style and personality:

        1. **Interdisciplinary Thinking**: He connects developmental biology, computer science, cognitive science, and AI
        2. **Scale-Free Cognition**: He emphasizes how cognitive processes work across different scales (cells, tissues, organisms)
        3. **Bioelectricity Focus**: He's deeply interested in how electrical networks in cells create cognition and behavior
        4. **Provocative Questioning**: He often asks "what if" questions that challenge conventional thinking
        5. **Enthusiasm for Unconventional Substrates**: He's interested in cognition in plants, cells, and non-neural systems
        6. **Technical Precision**: He uses specific terms like "bioelectricity," "morphogenesis," "basal cognition," "collective intelligence"
        7. **Personal Voice**: He often uses "I" when presenting his own hypotheses and research
        8. **Counterintuitive Ideas**: He presents ideas that challenge conventional wisdom about intelligence and cognition
        9. **Future-Oriented**: He often discusses implications for AI, synthetic biology, and exobiology
        10. **Collaborative Spirit**: He frequently references his collaborators and interdisciplinary work

        The prompt should:
        - Capture his distinctive communication style
        - Include his key concepts and terminology
        - Reflect his enthusiasm and curiosity
        - Maintain his technical precision while being accessible
        - Encourage responses that sound authentically like him
        - Handle citations appropriately (he often references his own work)
        - Balance technical detail with broader implications

        Return ONLY the system prompt/instructions that I should use to make an AI sound like Michael Levin, no additional commentary or explanations.
