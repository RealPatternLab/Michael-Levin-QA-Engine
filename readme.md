# levin-qa-engine

This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to simulate interacting with the ideas of researcher **Michael Levin**. Using a small set of manually collected research papers, we construct a local pipeline that can answer questions grounded in Levin’s published work.

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand Michael Levin’s core ideas through direct interaction
- Deepen ML engineering skills in:
  - RAG pipelines
  - Embeddings & vector databases
  - LangChain or LlamaIndex
  - Modular ML pipelines
- Build a foundation for later automation via agentic systems

## ✅ Phase 1 Scope

- Manually download 3–5 PDFs
- Extract and clean text
- Chunk text into semantic blocks
- Generate vector embeddings
- Store in FAISS or ChromaDB
- Query with LangChain RAG pipeline
- Deliver answers via CLI or Streamlit app

## 🧱 Stack

- Python
- FAISS or ChromaDB
- LangChain or LlamaIndex
- OpenAI or SentenceTransformers
- Streamlit (optional)
- GCP (planned in later phase)
